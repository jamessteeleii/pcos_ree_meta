  abstract = {Introduction: World powerlifting records within the super heavyweight class are typically held by those with not only the greatest absolute muscle strength but also the greatest amount of skeletal muscle mass (SM). Case Presentation: We examined the absolute and relative SM and muscle architecture of a 30 year old drug-free raw (i.e. without the use of powerlifting supportive equipment) powerlifter (1.84 m standing height and 183.1 kg body mass) who competes in the super heavyweight division and holds world records in the squat (477.5 kg), deadlift (392.5 kg), and total (1105 kg). Because the MRI magnet is too small for very large athletes, we used an ultrasound prediction equation to estimate SM. We also used ultrasound to determine muscle architecture (isolated muscle thickness, pennation angle and fascicle length). This powerlifter had large values of fat-free mass (138.6 kg) and total SM (58.0 kg) compared with previously published values. When calculating the powerlifting performance per unit SM, this lifter not only had high levels of absolute strength but also had high levels of relative strength per unit SM, particularly in the squat. Similarly, muscle thickness and pennation angle of the vastus lateralis were close to the highest values previously reported in the literature. Conclusions: These results suggest that this powerlifter may be close to a physiologic limit with respect to muscle size and geometry.},

  abstract = {TO the layman an act of volition is one of those obvious things, such as gravity or growth, which present no difficulty and suggest no problem. Their mechanism is so smooth in its working that the mind never dreams of the presence of a mystery. Add to which the fact that it is impossible to go through the process of willing and at the same time to contemplate and observe the process. Yet at least one difficulty has been noted by the crudest philosophy for ages past---the power of choice, the so-called freedom of the will. This, however, as Prof. Ach observes, is a function not of the will but of reason. He also well insists that the judgment ``I can do that which I will,'' has two distinct meanings, which have often been confused. The one meaning is positive, ``I have the capacity to carry out what I will''; ``can'' being equivalent to posse, pouvoir, overm\"ogen. The other is negative, ``It is my wish to do what I will.'' Psychologists are only too well aware that ``In no department of the science of mind does there prevail greater confusion and uncertainty than in that of Volition.''},

  abstract = {Acute hormonal and neuromuscular responses and recovery three days after the exercises were examined during the maximum repetitions (MR) and forced repetitions (FR) resistance exercise protocols in 16 male athletes. MR included 4 sets of leg presses, 2 sets of squats and 2 sets of knee extensions (with 12 RM) with a 2-min recovery between the sets and 4 min between the exercises. In FR the initial load was chosen to be higher than in MR so that the subject could not lift 12 repetitions per set by himself. After each set to failure the subject was assisted to perform the remaining repetitions to complete the 12 repetitions per set. Thus the exercise intensity was greater in FR than in MR. Both loading protocols led to the great acute increases (p {$<$} 0.05 - 0.001) in serum testosterone, free testosterone, cortisol and GH concentrations. However, the responses in cortisol (p {$<$} 0.05) and GH (p {$<$} 0.01) were larger in FR than in MR. The decrease of 56.5 \% (p {$<$} 0.001) in maximal isometric force in FR was greater (p {$<$} 0.001) than that of 38.3 \% in MR (p {$<$} 0.001) and force remained lower (p {$<$} 0.01) during the recovery in FR compared to MR. The larger decrease in isometric strength in FR than in MR was also associated with the decreased maximal voluntary EMG of the loaded muscles. The data indicate that the forced repetition exercise system induced greater acute hormonal and neuromuscular responses than a traditional maximum repetition exercise system and therefore it may be used to manipulate acute resistance exercise variables in athletes.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate acute hormonal and neuromuscular responses and recovery in strength athletes versus nonathletes during heavy resistance exercise performed with the forced and maximum repetitions training protocol. Eight male strength athletes (SA) with several years of continuous resistance training experience and 8 physically active but non-strength athletes (NA) volunteered as subjects. The experimental design comprised two loading sessions: maximum repetitions (MR) and forced repetitions (FR). MR included 12-RM squats for 4 sets with a 2-min recovery between sets. In FR the initial load was higher than in MR so that the subject could lift approximately 8 repetitions by himself and 4 additional repetitions with assistance. Before and after the loading protocols, blood samples were drawn to determine serum testosterone, free testosterone, cortisol and growth hormone concentrations, and blood lactate. Maximal voluntary isometric force and EMG activity of the leg extensors was measured before and after the loading as well as 24 and 48 hrs after the loading. The concentrations of the hormones measured increased significantly (p {$<$} .01-.001) after both loadings in both groups. The responses tended to be higher in FR than the MR loading and the increases of testosterone concentrations were significantly (p {$<$} .01) greater in both loadings in SA than in NA. Both loading protocols in both groups also led to neuromuscular fatigue observable with significant acute decreases in isometric strength by 32-52\% (p {$<$} .001) and in maximal iEMG (p {$<$} .05-01) associated with large increases in blood lactate. These data suggest that, at least in experienced strength athletes, the forced-repetition protocol is a viable alternative to the more traditional maximum-repetition protocol and may even be a superior approach.},

The ``width'' of the torque-angle relationship plateau became broader following isometric training at the long length. Despite marked differences in muscle architecture and functional adaptations between the groups, there was only a small-magnitude improvement in neuromuscular fatigue resistance, which was surprisingly negatively related to increased fascicle length in the long length-training group. , We evaluated the effects of differential muscle architectural adaptations on neuromuscular fatigue resistance. Seven young males and six females participated in this study. Using a longitudinal within-subject design, legs were randomly assigned to perform isometric training of the tibialis anterior (TA) three times per week for 8 wk at a short (S-group) or long muscle-tendon unit length (L-group). Before and following training, fascicle length (FL) and pennation angle (PA) of the TA were assessed. As well, fatigue-related time course changes in isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) torque and isotonic peak power (20\% MVC resistance) were determined before, immediately after, and 1, 2, 5, and 10 min following task failure. The fatiguing task consisted of repeated maximal effort isotonic (20\% MVC resistance) contractions over a 40{$^\circ$} range of motion until the participant reached a 40\% reduction in peak power. Although there was no clear improvement in neuromuscular fatigue resistance following training in either group ( P = 0.081; S-group: {$\sim$}20\%; L-group: {$\sim$}51\%), the change in neuromuscular fatigue resistance was related positively to the training-induced increase in PA ({$\sim$}6\%, P {$<$} 0.001) in the S-group ( r\,=\,0.739, P = 0.004) and negatively to the training-induced increase in FL ({$\sim$}4\%, P = 0.001) in the L-group ( r\,=\,-0.568, P = 0.043). Both groups recovered similarly for MVC torque and peak power after the fatiguing task as compared with before training. We suggest that the relationships between the changes in muscle architecture and neuromuscular fatigue resistance depend on the muscle-tendon unit lengths at which the training is performed. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Eight weeks of isometric training at a long or short muscle-tendon unit length increased and did not change fascicle length, respectively. The ``width'' of the torque-angle relationship plateau became broader following isometric training at the long length. Despite marked differences in muscle architecture and functional adaptations between the groups, there was only a small-magnitude improvement in neuromuscular fatigue resistance, which was surprisingly negatively related to increased fascicle length in the long length-training group.},

This study is a descriptive-correlational research. The study population comprised of patients with breast, lung and gastrointestinal cancer treated at the outpatient chemotherapy unit. Patients' self-efficacy and QoL were assessed using Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale and Strategies Used by Patients to Promote Health scale. The sample included 236 patients receiving chemotherapy for lung cancer (30.9\%), gastrointestinal (25.8\%) or breast cancers (25.4\%). The patients had little confidence in performing self-care self-efficacy during chemotherapy for the management of illness and chemotherapy-related side effects. The study found that the patients with cancer were moderately fatigued and all the domains of QoL of patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy were considerably impaired. Positive correlations were found between self-efficacy scores and fatigue scores (p {$<$} 0.001), and QoL scores (p {$<$} 0.001). Better self-efficacy beliefs were associated with better QoL and lower fatigue. Improving the cancer patients' self-confidence in performing self-care behaviours may have a positive impact on performing cognitive and behavioural fatigue management strategies and can influence positively the patients' QoL during chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {Background: Currently, the primary strategy for addressing polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) involves lifestyle modifications, with a focus on weight loss. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the impact of weight loss through dietary interventions on inflammatory status and hyperandrogenism in PCOS women. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted to identify randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies assessing the impact of diet-induced weight loss on circulating inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, IL-1{$\beta$}, TNF-{$\alpha$}), androgens (testosterone, androstenedione), SHBG, and luteinising hormone (LH) in PCOS women. The quality and risk of bias of the included studies were assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool for RCTs and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for cohort studies. Data were entered into RevMan software v5.9 for the calculation of standard mean difference (SMD) and the 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI) of circulating inflammatory markers, androgens, and LH between baseline and post-weight loss values. Results: Eleven studies (n = 323) were eligible for the systematic review, of which nine (n = 286) were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled analysis of data revealed a statistically significant decrease in circulating CRP (SMD 0.39, 95\%CI 0.22, 0.56; 9 studies, n = 286), IL-6 (SMD 0.37, 95\%Cl, 0.12, 0.61; 3 Studies, n = 140), TNF-{$\alpha$} (SMD 0.30, 95\%Cl, 0.07, 0.53; 4 Studies, n = 162), androstenedione (SMD 0.36, 95\%Cl, 0.13, 0.60; 4 studies, n = 147) and LH (SMD 0.30, 95\% Cl, 0.09, 0.51; 5 studies, n = 197) after weight loss compared to baseline levels among PCOS women. A meta-analysis of five studies (n = 173) showed a statistically significant increase in circulating SHBG after weight loss compared to baseline levels (SMD -0.43, 95\%Cl, -0.65, -0.21). Conclusions: These findings suggest that weight loss induced by dietary interventions seems to improve PCOS-related chronic inflammation and hyperandrogenism. The possible causative relationship between the improvement in inflammation and hyperandrogenism remains to be determined.},

  abstract = {In order to stimulate further adaptation toward specific training goals, progressive resistance training (RT) protocols are necessary. The optimal characteristics of strength-specific programs include the use of concentric (CON), eccentric (ECC), and isometric muscle actions and the performance of bilateral and unilateral single- and multiple-joint exercises. In addition, it is recommended that strength programs sequence exercises to optimize the preservation of exercise intensity (large before small muscle group exercises, multiple-joint exercises before single-joint exercises, and higher-intensity before lower-intensity exercises). For novice (untrained individuals with no RT experience or who have not trained for several years) training, it is recommended that loads correspond to a repetition range of an 8-12 repetition maximum (RM). For intermediate (individuals with approximately 6 months of consistent RT experience) to advanced (individuals with years of RT experience) training, it is recommended that individuals use a wider loading range from 1 to 12 RM in a periodized fashion with eventual emphasis on heavy loading (1-6 RM) using 3- to 5-min rest periods between sets performed at a moderate contraction velocity (1-2 s CON; 1-2 s ECC). When training at a specific RM load, it is recommended that 2-10\% increase in load be applied when the individual can perform the current workload for one to two repetitions over the desired number. The recommendation for training frequency is 2-3 d x wk(-1) for novice training, 3-4 d x wk(-1) for intermediate training, and 4-5 d x wk(-1) for advanced training. Similar program designs are recommended for hypertrophy training with respect to exercise selection and frequency. For loading, it is recommended that loads corresponding to 1-12 RM be used in periodized fashion with emphasis on the 6-12 RM zone using 1- to 2-min rest periods between sets at a moderate velocity. Higher volume, multiple-set programs are recommended for maximizing hypertrophy. Progression in power training entails two general loading strategies: 1) strength training and 2) use of light loads (0-60\% of 1 RM for lower body exercises; 30-60\% of 1 RM for upper body exercises) performed at a fast contraction velocity with 3-5 min of rest between sets for multiple sets per exercise (three to five sets). It is also recommended that emphasis be placed on multiple-joint exercises especially those involving the total body. For local muscular endurance training, it is recommended that light to moderate loads (40-60\% of 1 RM) be performed for high repetitions ({$>$}15) using short rest periods ({$<$}90 s). In the interpretation of this position stand as with prior ones, recommendations should be applied in context and should be contingent upon an individual's target goals, physical capacity, and training status.},

  abstract = {To maximise their utility, injury and illness surveillance data must be consistently collected and accurately classified. To achieve this goal, research groups have published 11 sport-specific or setting-specific consensus statements on the methods of recording and reporting of epidemiological data on injury and illness in sport to date.1 However, all this effort may be undermined if the sporting activities are not accurately described and classified in the first instance. Here at British Open Journal of Sport and Exercise Medicine (BOSEM), we can educate our editorial board and institute editorial policies to ensure adequate reporting in future publications. But how can we simplify this process for authors, peer reviewers, and editors to ensure a sustained shift in best practice across the whole discipline? This editorial aims to highlight the issue and start a conversation about how we, as a community, can resolve it. Sports are not always accurately identified in the literature. In a literature review of `volleyball', the authors found many studies did not specify the type of volleyball.2--7 Indoor volleyball and beach volleyball have different injury mechanisms and demands on their players. For instance, indoor volleyball is played indoors on a hardcourt with six shod players per team, whereas beach volleyball \dots},

Comparison of isolated lumbar extension strength in competitive and noncompetitive powerlifters, and recreationally trained men. J Strength Cond Res 35(3): 652-658, 2021-Low-back strength has been shown to significantly impact performance in a plethora of sports. Aside from its effect on sport performance, low-back strength is strongly associated with low-back pain. A sport that heavily involves the lower-back musculature is powerlifting. This study looked to compare isolated lumbar extension (ILEX) strength in competitive and noncompetitive powerlifters, and recreationally trained men. Thirteen competitive powerlifters (CPL group; 31.9 \textpm{} 7.6 years; 173.4 \textpm{} 5.5 cm; 91.75 \textpm{} 18.7 kg), 10 noncompetitive powerlifters (NCPL group; 24 \textpm{} 3.5 years; 179 \textpm{} 4.8 cm; 92.39 \textpm{} 15.73 kg), and 36 recreationally trained men (RECT group; 24.9 \textpm{} 6.5 years; 178.5 \textpm{} 5.2 cm; 81.6 \textpm{} 10.0 kg) were tested for ILEX. Isolated lumbar extension strength was measured at every 12{$^\circ$} throughout subject's full range of motion (ROM) and expressed as the following: "strength index (SI)" calculated as the area under a torque curve from multiple angle testing, average torque produced across each joint angle (AVG), and maximum torque produced at a single angle (MAX). Deadlift and squat strength were measured using 1 repetition maximum for the competitive and noncompetitive powerlifters. The following powerlifting characteristics were recorded for the competitive and noncompetitive powerlifters: primary deadlift stance, primary squat bar position, use of belt, use of performance-enhancing drugs, and use of exercises to target the lower-back musculature. Significant between-group effects were found for subject characteristics (age, stature, body mass, and ROM). However, analysis of covariance with subject characteristics as covariates found no significant between-group effects for SI (p = 0.824), AVG (p = 0.757), or MAX (p = 0.572). In conclusion, this study suggests that powerlifting training likely has little impact on conditioning of the lumbar extensors.},

Effects of exercise modality during additional "high-intensity interval training" on aerobic fitness and strength in powerlifting and strongman athletes. J Strength Cond Res 32(2): 450-457, 2018-Powerlifters and strongman athletes have a necessity for optimal levels of muscular strength while maintaining sufficient aerobic capacity to perform and recover between events. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has been popularized for its efficacy in improving both aerobic fitness and strength but never assessed within the aforementioned population group. This study looked to compare the effect of exercise modality, e.g., a traditional aerobic mode (AM) and strength mode (SM), during HIIT on aerobic fitness and strength. Sixteen well resistance-trained male participants, currently competing in powerlifting and strongman events, completed 8 weeks of approximately effort- and volume-matched HIIT in 2 groups: AM (cycling, n = 8) and SM (resistance training, n = 8). Aerobic fitness was measured as predicted V[Combining Dot Above]O2max using the YMCA 3 minutes step test and strength as predicted 1 repetition maximum from a 4-6RM test using a leg extension. Both groups showed significant improvements in both strength and aerobic fitness. There was a significant between-group difference for aerobic fitness improvements favoring the AM group (p {$\leq$} 0.05). There was no between-group difference for change in strength. Magnitude of change using within-group effect size for aerobic fitness and strength was considered large for each group (aerobic fitness, AM = 2.6, SM = 2.0; strength, AM = 1.9, SM = 1.9). In conclusion, our results support enhanced strength and aerobic fitness irrespective of exercise modality (e.g., traditional aerobic and resistance training). However, powerlifters and strongman athletes wishing to enhance their aerobic fitness should consider HIIT using an aerobic HIIT mode.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Increases in muscular strength may increase sports performance, reduce injury risk, are associated with a plethora of health markers, as well as exerting positive psychological effects. Due to their efficiency and effectiveness in increasing total body muscular strength, multi-joint exercises like the powerlifts, i.e.: the squat (SQ), bench-press (BP) and deadlift (DL), are widely used by active individuals as well as athletes in the pursuit of increasing strength. To date, the concept of a minimum dose, i.e. "what is the minimum one needs to do to increase 1-repetition maximum (1RM) strength?" has not been directly examined in the literature, especially in the context of the powerlifts. This review aims to explore the current available evidence around the minimum effective training dose required to increase 1RM strength in trained individuals in an attempt to enhance the practical guidelines around resistance-training as well as provide active individuals, athletes and coaches with more flexibility when designing a training protocol. METHODS: One reviewer independently conducted the search in a PRISMA systematic approach using PubMed, SportDiscus and Google Scholar databases. The databases were searched with the following search terms/phrases and Boolean operators: "training volume" AND "powerlifting" OR "1RM strength" OR "powerlifters", "low volume" AND "powerlifting" OR "powerlifting" OR "1RM strength", "high vs low volume" AND "powerlifting" OR "1RM strength", "minimum effective training dose 1RM". Meta-analyses were performed to estimate the change in 1RM strength for the lowest dose group in the included studies. RESULTS: From the initial 2629 studies, 6 studies met our inclusion criteria. All identified studies showed that a single set performed minimum 1 time and maximum 3 times per week was sufficient to induce significant 1RM strength gains. Meta-analysis of 5 studies showed an estimated increase for overall 1RM of 12.09~kg [95\% CIs 8.16~kg-16.03~kg], an increase of 17.48~kg [95\% CIs 8.51~kg-26.46~kg] for the SQ, and 8.25~kg [95\% CIs 0.68~kg-15.83~kg] for the BP. All of the included studies contained details on most of the variables comprising "training dose", such as: weekly and per session sets and repetitions as well as intensity of effort. Specific information regarding load (\%1RM) was not provided by all studies. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present systematic review suggest that performing a single set of 6-12 repetitions with loads ranging from approximately 70-85\% 1RM 2-3 times per week with high intensity of effort (reaching volitional or momentary failure) for 8-12~weeks can produce suboptimal, yet significant increases in SQ and BP 1RM strength in resistance-trained men. However, because of the lack of research, it is less clear as to whether these improvements may also be achievable in DL 1RM strength or in trained women and highly trained strength athletes.

  abstract = {The aim of this multi-experiment paper was to explore the concept of the minimum effective training dose (METD) required to increase 1-repetition-maximum (1RM) strength in powerlifting (PL) athletes. The METD refers to the least amount of training required to elicit meaningful increases in 1RM strength. A series of five studies utilising mixed methods, were conducted using PL athletes \& coaches of all levels in an attempt to better understand the METD for 1RM strength. The studies of this multi-experiment paper are: an interview study with elite PL athletes and highly experienced PL coaches (n = 28), an interview and survey study with PL coaches and PL athletes of all levels (n = 137), two training intervention studies with intermediate-advanced PL athletes (n = 25) and a survey study with competitive PL athletes of different levels (n = 57). PL athletes looking to train with a METD approach can do so by performing \textasciitilde 3-6 working sets of 1-5 repetitions each week, with these sets spread across 1-3 sessions per week per powerlift, using loads above 80\% 1RM at a Rate of Perceived Exertion (RPE) of 7.5-9.5 for 6-12 weeks and expect to gain strength. PL athletes who wish to further minimize their time spent training can perform autoregulated single repetition sets at an RPE of 9-9.5 though they should expect that strength gains will be less likely to be meaningful. However, the addition of 2-3 back-off sets at \textasciitilde 80\% of the single repetitions load, may produce greater gains over 6 weeks while following a 2-3-1 squat-bench press-deadlift weekly training frequency. When utilizing accessory exercises in the context of METD, PL athletes typically utilize 1-3 accessory exercises per powerlift, at an RPE in the range of 7-9 and utilize a repetition range of \textasciitilde 6-10 repetitions.},

Ten competitive powerlifters were split into 2 groups (MAX group and PER group) and participated in a 10-week training intervention either following a "daily max" training protocol or a traditional periodized training protocol while preparing for competition. All participants underwent 1RM testing for squat (SQ), bench press (BP) and deadlift (DL) prior to the 10-week intervention. The MAX group performed single sets of single repetitions using a load equating to an RPE rating of 9{$^-$}9.5 while the PER group performed higher volume periodized training with loads ranging from 70\%1RM up to 93\%1RM as well as a taper at the final weeks of the training intervention. Both groups were tested after the 10-week training intervention at the Greek IPF-affiliate National Championships. In the PER group, powerlifting (PL) total increased for P1 and P3 by 2\% and 6.5\% respectively while P2 experienced no change. In the MAX group PL total increased for P1 and P2 by 4.8\% and 4.2\% respectively while it decreased by 0.5\%, 3.4\% and 5\% for P3, P4 and P5 respectively. In the MAX group peri PL total increased for P1{$^-$}4 by 3.6\%, 4.2\%, 4.5\% and 1.8\% respectively while it decreased by 1.2\% for P5. The results of this pilot study show that single-set, single-rep, RPE based 'daily max' training may be a favorable strategy for some beginner-intermediate powerlifters preparing for competition while it may lead to performance decreases for others. Further, it suggests that performance may be comparable to traditional periodized training during shorter training cycles, though future work with larger samples is needed to further test this. Practically 'daily max' training may be useful for PL athletes looking to maintain strength during periods with limited training time available.},

However, its validity is reliant upon accuracy in the ability to predict MF which may be affected by congruence of the perception of effort compared with the actual effort required. The present study examined participants with at least 1 year of resistance training experience predicting their proximity to MF in two different experiments using a deception design. Within each experiment participants performed four trials of knee extensions with single sets (i.e., bouts of repetitions) to their self-determined repetition maximum (sdRM; when they predicted they could not complete the next repetition if attempted and thus would reach MF if they did) and MF (i.e., where despite attempting to do so they could not complete the current repetition). For the first experiment (n = 14) participants used loads equal to 70\% of a one repetition maximum (1RM; i.e., the heaviest load that could be lifted for a single repetition) performed in a separate baseline session. Aiming to minimize participants between day variability in repetition performances, in the second separate experiment (n = 24) they used loads equal to 70\% of their daily isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Results suggested that participants typically under predicted the number of repetitions they could perform to MF with a meta-analytic estimate across experiments of 2.0 [95\%CIs 0.0 to 4.0]. Participants with at least 1 year of resistance training experience are likely not adequately accurate at gauging effort in submaximal conditions. This suggests that perceptions of effort during resistance training task performance may not be congruent with the actual effort required. This has implications for controlling, programming, and manipulating the actual effort in resistance training and potentially on the magnitude of desired adaptations such as improvements in muscular hypertrophy and strength.},

Within each experiment participants performed four trials of knee extensions with single sets (i.e., bouts of repetitions) to their self-determined repetition maximum (sdRM; when they predicted they could not complete the next repetition if attempted and thus would reach MF if they did) and MF (i.e., where despite attempting to do so they could not complete the current repetition). For the first experiment (n = 14) participants used loads equal to 70\% of a one repetition maximum (1RM; i.e., the heaviest load that could be lifted for a single repetition) performed in a separate baseline session. Aiming to minimize participants between day variability in repetition performances, in the second separate experiment (n = 24) they used loads equal to 70\% of their daily isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Results suggested that participants typically under predicted the number of repetitions they could perform to MF with a meta-analytic estimate across experiments of 2.0 [95\%CIs 0.0 to 4.0]. Participants with at least 1 year of resistance training experience are likely not adequately accurate at gauging effort in submaximal conditions. This suggests that perceptions of effort during resistance training task performance may not be congruent with the actual effort required. This has implications for controlling, programming, and manipulating the actual effort in resistance training and potentially on the magnitude of desired adaptations such as improvements in muscular hypertrophy and strength.},

By operating on generic object types, these packages unite research innovations in corpus linguistics, natural language processing, machine learning, statistics, and digital humanities. We begin by extrapolating on the theoretical benefits of R as an elaborate gluing language for bringing together several areas of expertise and compare it to linguistic concordancers and other tool-based approaches to text analysis in the digital humanities. We then showcase the practical benefits of an ecosystem by illustrating how R packages have been integrated into a digital humanities project. Throughout, the focus is on moving beyond the bag-of-words, lexical frequency model by incorporating linguistically-driven analyses in research.},

  abstract = {NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic for this review? We discuss the dichotomization of continuous-level physiological measurements into 'responders' and 'non-responders' when interventions/treatments are examined in robust parallel-group studies. What advances does it highlight? Sample responder counts are biased by pre-to-post within-subject variability. Sample differences in counts may be explained wholly by differences in mean response, even without individual response heterogeneity and even if test-retest measurement error informs the choice of response threshold. A less biased and more informative approach uses the SD of individual responses to estimate the chance a new person from the population of interest will be a responder. ABSTRACT: As a follow-up to our 2015 review, we cover more issues on the topic of 'response heterogeneity', which we define as clinically important individual differences in the physiological responses to the same treatment/intervention that cannot be attributed to random within-subject variability. We highlight various pitfalls with the common practice of counting the number of 'responders', 'non-responders' and 'adverse responders' in samples that have been given certain treatments or interventions for research purposes. We focus on the classical parallel-group randomized controlled trial and assume typical good practice in trial design. We show that sample responder counts are biased because individuals differ in terms of pre-to-post within-subject random variability in the study outcome(s) and not necessarily treatment response. Ironically, sample differences in responder counts may be explained wholly by sample differences in mean response, even if there is no response heterogeneity at all. Sample comparisons of responder counts also have relatively low statistical precision. These problems do not depend on how the response threshold has been selected, e.g. on the basis of a measurement error statistic, and are not rectified fully by the use of confidence intervals for individual responses in the sample. The dichotomization of individual responses in a research sample is fraught with pitfalls. Less biased approaches for estimating the proportion of responders in a population of interest are now available. Importantly, these approaches are based on the SD for true individual responses, directly incorporating information from the control group.},

  abstract = {NEW FINDINGS: What is the topic of this review? In 'personalized medicine', various plots and analyses are purported to quantify individual differences in intervention response, identify responders/non-responders and explore response moderators or mediators. What advances does it highlight? We highlight the impact of within-subject random variation, which is inevitable even with 'gold-standard' measurement tools/protocols and sometimes so substantial that it explains all apparent individual response differences. True individual response differences are quantified only by comparing the SDs of changes between intervention and comparator arms. When these SDs are similar, true individual response differences are clinically unimportant and further analysis unwarranted. Within the 'hot topic' of personalized medicine, we scrutinize common approaches for presenting and quantifying individual differences in the physiological response to an intervention. First, we explain how popular plots used to present individual differences in response are contaminated by random within-subject variation and the regression to the mean artefact. Using a simulated data set of blood pressure measurements, we show that large individual differences in physiological response can be suggested by some plots and analyses, even when the true magnitude of response is exactly the same in all individuals. Second, we present the appropriate designs and analysis approaches for quantifying the true interindividual variation in physiological response. It is imperative to include a comparator arm/condition (or derive information from a prior relevant repeatability study) to quantify true interindividual differences in response. The most important statistic is the SD of changes in the intervention arm, which should be compared with the same SD in the comparator arm or from a prior repeatability study in the same population conducted over the same duration as the particular intervention. Only if the difference between these SDs is clinically relevant is it logical to go on to explore any moderators or mediators of the intervention effect that might explain the individual response. To date, very few researchers have compared these SDs before making claims about individual differences in physiological response and their importance to personalized medicine.},

Considering that the general public typically has access to plate-loaded machines, the effectiveness and safety of power training using plate-loaded machines compared to pneumatic machines is an important consideration. The purpose of this investigation was to compare the effects of high-velocity training using pneumatic machines (Pn) versus standard plate-loaded machines (PL). METHODS: Independently-living older adults, 60years or older were randomized into two groups: pneumatic machine (Pn, n=19) and plate-loaded machine (PL, n=17). After 12weeks of high-velocity training twice per week, groups were analyzed using an intention-to-treat approach. Primary outcomes were lower body power measured using a linear transducer and upper body power using medicine ball throw. Secondary outcomes included lower and upper body muscle muscle strength, the Physical Performance Battery (PPB), gallon jug test, the timed up-and-go test, and self-reported function using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) and an online video questionnaire. Outcome assessors were blinded to group membership. RESULTS: Lower body power significantly improved in both groups (Pn: 19\%, PL: 31\%), with no significant difference between the groups (Cohen's d=0.4, 95\% CI (-1.1, 0.3)). Upper body power significantly improved only in the PL group, but showed no significant difference between the groups (Pn: 3\%, PL: 6\%). For balance, there was a significant difference between the groups favoring the Pn group (d=0.7, 95\% CI (0.1, 1.4)); however, there were no statistically significant differences between groups for PPB, gallon jug transfer, muscle muscle strength, timed up-and-go or self-reported function. No serious adverse events were reported in either of the groups. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumatic and plate-loaded machines were effective in improving lower body power and physical function in older adults. The results suggest that power training can be safely and effectively performed by older adults using either pneumatic or plate-loaded machines.},

  abstract = {The present article presents an integrative theoretical framework to explain and to predict psychological changes achieved by different modes of treatment. This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the propose model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from four principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. The more dependable the experiential sources, the greater are the changes in perceive self-efficacy. A number of factors are identified as influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arising from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

  abstract = {The increased global prevalence of obesity over the last 40-years has driven a rise in prevalence of obesity-related co-morbidities, including polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). On a background of genetic susceptibility, PCOS often becomes clinically manifest following weight gain, commonly during adolescence. A common endocrinopathy affecting between 6\%-10\% of reproductive-age women, PCOS presents with the cardinal features of hyperandrogenism, reproductive and metabolic dysfunction. PCOS associates with insulin resistance, independently of (but amplified by) obesity. Insulin resistance in PCOS is characterized by abnormal post-receptor signalling within the phosphatidylinositol-kinase (PI3-K) pathway. Multiple factors (including most notably, weight gain) contribute towards the severity of insulin resistance in PCOS. Compensatory hyperinsulinaemia ensues, resulting in over-stimulation of the (intact) post-receptor mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP-K) insulin pathway, with consequent implications for steroidogenesis and ovarian function. In this concise review, we explore the effects of weight gain and obesity on the pathogenesis of PCOS from the perspective of its three cardinal features of hyperandrogenism, reproductive and metabolic dysfunction, with a focus on the central mediating role of the insulin pathway.

The authors also found that rater source effects of leniency and severity, even though statistically significant, did not substantially affect the observed score at the item and scale levels.

This paper describes an online survey (N=462) of 24 women with PCOS, 299 healthy control women, 47 women who possibly had undiagnosed PCOS, and 92 men. The groups were compared for symptoms of mood and behavioral symptoms typical of reactive (postprandial) hypoglycemia. The outcome measures were two questionnaires that measure states associated with hypoglycemia: the Hypoglycemia Symptom Checklist-7 (HSC-7), which measures behavioral symptoms and the Mood Adjective Checklist (MACL), which measures emotional states. Controlling for age and body mass index (BMI) using between-groups analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), the women with PCOS scored significantly higher than the other three groups (p{$<$}0.001) on the outcome measures. These differences remained statistically significant in a subset of twelve women with PCOS compared to twelve healthy control women closely matched for age, BMI, and eating behavior. The findings are suggestive of hypoglycemia-related mood and behavioral problems in PCOS. Future research should test whether blood glucose levels correlate with these symptoms in PCOS, and whether a low glycemic index ('low-GI') diet improves the symptoms.},

Although unified recommendations for use of key CGM metrics have been established in three separate peer-reviewed articles, formal adoption by diabetes professional organizations and guidance in the practical application of these metrics in clinical practice have been lacking.

  abstract = {Explosive movements requiring high force and power outputs are integral to many sports, posing distinct challenges for the neuromuscular system. Traditional resistance training can improve muscle strength, power, endurance, and range of motion; however, evidence regarding its effects on athletic performance, such as sprint speed, agility, and jump height, remains conflicting. The specificity of resistance training movements, including velocity, contraction type, and joint angles affects performance outcomes, demonstrates advantages when matching training modalities with targeted sports activities. However, independent of movement speed, the intent to contract explosively (ballistic) has also demonstrated high velocity-specific training adaptations. The purpose of this narrative review was to assess the impact of explosive or ballistic contraction intent on velocity-specific training adaptations. Such movement intent may predominantly elicit motor efferent neural adaptations, including motor unit recruitment and rate coding enhancements. Plyometrics, which utilize rapid stretch-shortening cycle movements, may augment high-speed movement efficiency and muscle activation, possibly leading to improved motor control through adaptations like faster eccentric force absorption, reduced amortization periods, and quicker transitions to explosive concentric contractions. An optimal training paradigm for power and performance enhancement might involve a combination of maximal explosive intent training with heavier loads and plyometric exercises with lighter loads at high velocities. This narrative review synthesizes key literature to answer whether contraction intent or movement speed is more critical for athletic performance enhancement, ultimately advocating for an integrative approach to resistance training tailored for sports-specific explosive action.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The fatigue of a muscle or muscle group can produce global responses to a variety of systems (i.e., cardiovascular, endocrine, and others). There are also reported strength and endurance impairments of non-exercised muscles following the fatigue of another muscle; however, the literature is inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether non-local muscle fatigue (NLMF) occurs following the performance of a fatiguing bout of exercise of a different muscle(s). DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. SEARCH AND INCLUSION: A systematic literature search using a Boolean search strategy was conducted with PubMed, SPORTDiscus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar in April 2020, and was supplemented with additional 'snowballing' searches up to September 2020. To be included in our analysis, studies had to include at least one intentional performance measure (i.e., strength, endurance, or power), which if reduced could be considered evidence of muscle fatigue, and also had to include the implementation of a fatiguing protocol to a location (i.e., limb or limbs) that differed to those for which performance was measured. We excluded studies that measured only mechanistic variables such as electromyographic activity, or spinal/supraspinal excitability. After search and screening, 52 studies were eligible for inclusion including 57 groups of participants (median sample\,=\,11) and a total of 303 participants. RESULTS: The main multilevel meta-analysis model including all effects sizes (278 across 50 clusters [median\,=\,4, range\,=\,1 to 18 effects per cluster) revealed a trivial point estimate with high precision for the interval estimate [- 0.02 (95\% CIs\,=\,- 0.14 to 0.09)], yet with substantial heterogeneity (Q(277)\,=\,642.3, p\,{$<$}\,0.01), I2\,=\,67.4\%). Subgroup and meta-regression analyses showed that NLMF effects were not moderated by study design (between vs. within-participant), homologous vs. heterologous effects, upper or lower body effects, participant training status, sex, age, the time of post-fatigue protocol measurement, or the severity of the fatigue protocol. However, there did appear to be an effect of type of outcome measure where both strength [0.11 (95\% CIs\,=\,0.01-0.21)] and power outcomes had trivial effects [- 0.01 (95\% CIs\,=\,- 0.24 to 0.22)], whereas endurance outcomes showed moderate albeit imprecise effects [- 0.54 (95\% CIs\,=\,- 0.95 to - 0.14)]. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the findings do not support the existence of a general NLMF effect; however, when examining specific types of performance outcomes, there may be an effect specifically upon endurance-based outcomes (i.e., time to task failure). However, there are relatively fewer studies that have examined endurance effects or mechanisms explaining this possible effect, in addition to fewer studies including women or younger and older participants, and considering causal effects of prior training history through the use of longitudinal intervention study designs. Thus, it seems pertinent that future research on NLMF effects should be redirected towards these still relatively unexplored areas.},

Methods~           After body composition assessment (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry), two submaximal cycling step tests were performed in ambient (20{$^\circ$}C, 40\%) and hot and humid (30{$^\circ$}C, 60\% [HH]) conditions from which measures of gross efficiency (GE), lactate-power landmarks, and heart rate responses were calculated. In addition, thermoregulatory and sweat responses were collected throughout. V˙O2peak and peak power output (PPO) were also identified after a separate ramp test to exhaustion.           Results~           V˙O2peak and PPO were 5.91 L{$\cdot$}min-1 (84 mL{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}min-1) and 525 W, respectively, whereas mean GE values were 23.0\% and 23.6\% for ambient and HH conditions, respectively. In addition to superior GE, power output at 4 mmol{$\cdot$}L-1 lactate was higher in HH versus ambient conditions (429.6 vs 419.0 W) supporting anecdotal reports from the participant of good performance in the heat. Peak core and skin temperature, sweat rate, and electrolyte content were higher in HH conditions. Body fat percentage was 9.5\%, whereas total fat mass, lean mass, and bone mineral content were 6.7, 61.5, and 2.8 kg, respectively.           Conclusion~           The aerobic physiology and PPO values indentified are among the highest reported for professional road cyclists. Notably, the participant displayed both a high V˙O2peak and GE, which is uncommon among elite cyclists and may be a contributing factor to their success in elite cycling. In addition, performance in HH conditions was strong, suggesting effective thermoregulatory physiology. In summary, this is the first study to report physiological characteristics of a multiple Tour de France champion in close to peak condition and suggests what may be the prerequisite physiological and thermoregulatory capacities for success at this level.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Ammonia inhalants, also known as smelling salts, are preparations of ammonia designed to treat fainting but more commonly used by athletes to boost awareness and arousal during competition. Despite their widespread use, the physiological and performance-enhancing effects of ammonia inhalants remain poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to review the current literature surrounding the benefits, risks, and physiological effects of ammonia inhalants. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: An extensive literature review of articles pertaining to ammonia inhalants was performed through MEDLINE and Google Scholar. The search terms "smelling salts," "ammonia inhalants," "strength," "performance," "head injury," and "concussion" were used. STUDY DESIGN: Clinical review. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level 4. RESULTS: The physiological response to acute ammonia inhalation includes cerebral vasodilation and heart rate elevation without change in blood pressure. The existing evidence demonstrates an ergogenic benefit to ammonia inhalant use only during repeated bouts of high-intensity exercise; in these subjects, ammonia inhalation was associated with increased power as measured by the Wingate anaerobic test. In contrast, there is no performance benefit to ammonia inhalants in a short burst of maximal effort despite elevated arousal and an associated perception of performance enhancement. Importantly, ammonia inhalants have no role in medical management of head injuries, as they have the potential to exacerbate an underlying brain injury due to the involuntary withdrawal reflex associated with ammonia inhalation. Furthermore, the signs and symptoms of a concussion or more threatening head injury may be masked by ammonia inhalation and lead to continued participation in competition, causing additional harm. CONCLUSION: Ammonia inhalants have no role in medical management of head injuries and have limited benefit with regards to sports performance. STRENGTH OF RECOMMENDATION: B.},

  abstract = {A link between lactate and muscular exercise was seen already more than 200 years ago. The blood lactate concentration (BLC) is sensitive to changes in exercise intensity and duration. Multiple BLC threshold concepts define different points on the BLC power curve during various tests with increasing power (INCP). The INCP test results are affected by the increase in power over time. The maximal lactate steady state (MLSS) is measured during a series of prolonged constant power (CP) tests. It detects the highest aerobic power without metabolic energy from continuing net lactate production, which is usually sustainable for 30 to 60 min. BLC threshold and MLSS power are highly correlated with the maximum aerobic power and athletic endurance performance. The idea that training at threshold intensity is particularly effective has no evidence. Three BLC-orientated intensity domains have been established: (1) training up to an intensity at which the BLC clearly exceeds resting BLC, light- and moderate-intensity training focusing on active regeneration or high-volume endurance training (Intensity {$<$} Threshold); (2) heavy endurance training at work rates up to MLSS intensity (Threshold {$\leq$} Intensity {$\leq$} MLSS); and (3) severe exercise intensity training between MLSS and maximum oxygen uptake intensity mostly organized as interval and tempo work (Intensity {$>$} MLSS). High-performance endurance athletes combining very high training volume with high aerobic power dedicate 70 to 90\% of their training to intensity domain 1 (Intensity {$<$} Threshold) in order to keep glycogen homeostasis within sustainable limits.},

Furthermore, prolonged cognitive engagement leads to mental fatigue, consisting of subjective feeling of exhaustion and decline in performance. Despite the intuitive characterization of fatigue as an increase in subjective effort perception, the effect of fatigue on effort cost has never been tested experimentally. To this end, sixty participants in 2 separate experiments underwent a forced-choice working memory task following either a fatigue-inducing (i.e. cognitive task involving working memory, conflict and switch costs) or a control manipulation. We measured fatigue in terms of subjective feeling and performance decrement and assessed effort in terms of subjective perception and task avoidance. Subjects exhibited only weak avoidance of the working memory task, with stronger influence of reward than task difficulty on their decisions. In addition, we found that task avoidance did not systematically change following the fatigue manipulation but that variations in task avoidance correlated with fatigue-induced performance decline. The other measures of fatigue and effort were unrelated to each other. Our findings suggest that subjective fatigue may develop independently of task avoidance and suggest an ``anticipatory regulation'' model in which fatigue urges subjects to stop in anticipation of possible, future adverse consequences.},

  abstract = {Test--retest is a concept that is routinely evaluated during the validation phase of many measurement tools. However, this term covers at least two related but very different concepts: reliability and agreement. Reliability is the ability of a measure applied twice upon the same respondents to produce the same ranking on both occasions. Agreement requires the measurement tool to produce twice the same exact values. An analysis of research papers showed that the distinction between both concepts remains anything but clear, and that the current practice is to evaluate reliability only, generally on the basis of the sole Pearson's correlation. This practice is very problematic in the context of longitudinal studies because it becomes difficult to determine whether a difference between two successive observations is attributable to a real change of the respondents or only to the characteristics of the measurement tool, which then leads to a possible misinterpretation of the results. More focus should be given on the real interpretation of linear correlation, and when agreement is required in addition to reliability, then correct alternative, such as the Bland--Altman plot, should be more generally used.},

Benefits and challenges to reflexivity under three types of researcher's position are discussed and illustrated by means of case examples: (1) reflexivity when researcher shares the experience of study participants, (2) reflexivity when researcher moves from the position of an outsider to the position of an insider in the course of the study, and (3) reflexivity when researcher has no personal familiarity or experience with what is being studied. Strategies are offered for harvesting the benefits of researcher's familiarity with the subject and for curbing its potentially negative effects. Directions for future research are suggested.},

A crucial, overlooked distinction within the philosophical and scientific literatures is the distinction between theories that seek to explain effort and theories that seek to explain the feeling of effort. Lacking a clear distinction between these two phenomena makes the literature hard to navigate. To advance in the unification and development of this area, this article provides an overview of the main theories of the nature of effort and the nature of the feeling of effort, and then discusses how efforts and their feelings are related. Two key takeaways emerge. First, there is widespread agreement that efforts are goal-directed actions. Second, one of the main philosophical issues to be decided is whether feelings of effort should be defined by reference to efforts (effort-first approach), or whether efforts are defined by reference to the feeling of effort (feeling-first approach).},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders among women of reproductive age. Symptomes and complications of PCOS have adverse effect on quality of life among concerned women. Most research findings suggest that PCOS is associated with eating disorders, but there are inconsistent results in connection with their relationship in the published literature. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of eating disorders among women with PCOS. METHOD: Body mass index (BMI), Eating Attitudes Test (EAT) and Eating Behaviour Severity Scale (EBSS) were used to measure eating attitudes and behaviors. Furthermore PCOS symptomes were measured by Ferriman-Gallwey Score, Global Acne Grading Score, Savin Scale and other pcos symptoms were also accessed. A total of 318 women were included in this analysis. The sample consists of a PCOS group (N=95), a control group (N=100) and a hyperandrogen group (N=123). The Prevalence of clinical bulimia nervosa was 5.3\%, subclinical anorexia nervosa 1.1\% and subclinical bulimia nervosa was 10.5\% among PCOS women. 1.6\% subclinical bulimia nervosa was detected in the hyperandrogen group. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate that the prevalence of clinical and subclinical bulimia nervosa is increased among women with PCOS compared to healthy women. Eating disorders can have significant negative influence on the outcome of the treatment of PCOS. To sum up, these findings suggest that it should be necessary to pay attention to the screening of eating disorders, and the findings also reveals that psychological treatment of eating disorders among women with PCOS is relevant.},

A systematic research was conducted through of PubMed/MEDLINE, SPORTDiscus and Web of Science following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses statement guidelines. A total of 52 meta-analyses were found, of which 14 met the inclusion criteria. These studies were published between 2009 and 2020 and comprised 178 primary studies corresponding to 4,784 participants. Following a methodological quality analysis, nine meta-analyses were categorized as high quality, presenting values of 81--88\%. The remaining meta-analyses were rated as moderate quality, with values between 63--75\%. Based on this umbrella review, we can state that at least 10 sets per week per muscle group is optimal, that eccentric contractions seem important, very slow repetitions ({$\geq$}10 s) should be avoided, and that blood flow restriction might be beneficial for some individuals. In addition, other variables as, exercise order, time of the day and type of periodization appear not to directly influence the magnitude of muscle mass gains. These findings provide valuable information for the design and configuration of the resistance training program with the aim of optimizing muscle hypertrophy.},

In total 750 records were found, of which eight met the inclusion criteria. Results: These studies included 120 men and 22 women. Among the analysed physical parameters, the most commonly employed were strength and cardiorespiratory measures, level of perceived exertion, neuromuscular output and sport-specific test performance. Discussion: Four out of the eight studies reported positive effects of AI, while no statistically significant changes in these parameters were found in three studies. Conclusions: However, in one study examining postural stability in golfers, the use of AI led to a decrease in performance component. Only one study investigated professional athletes.},

However, there is little research examining isometric knee extensor RTs effects upon soccer related skills.

Method: Sixteen female, university level, amateur soccer players (age 20.5 \textpm{} 1.1 years) were assigned to either a control or experimental group. The experimental group trained 1x/week for 6-weeks performing repeated maximal voluntary isometric con tractions (MVIC) for the knee extensors alongside regular soccer training and the control group participated in soccer training alone. Knee extension MVICs were performed at seven joint angles and peak torque measured. Results: Outcome measures included, countermovement jump (CMJ), kicking distance (KD), straight sprint speed and zigzag sprint speed, with (SSB and ZSB, respectively) and without (SS and ZS, respectively) a ball. Significant increases (p {$<$} 0.05) in knee extensor MVIC (28.9\%) occurred in the experimental group. Significant differences (p {$<$} 0.05) between the experimental group and control group were found for change in CMJ (2.24\% vs -0.78\% respectively) and KD (8.8\% vs -2.5\% respectively); however, change in SSB, ZSB, SS, or ZS were non-significant for both within- and between-group comparisons.

Previous work has illustrated a VSTM advantage among action video game players (Boot et al. Acta Psychologica 129:387--398, 2008). A growing body of literature has suggested that action video game playing can bolster visual cognitive abilities in a domain-general manner, including abilities related to visual attention and the speed of processing, providing some potential bases for this VSTM advantage. In the present study, we investigated the VSTM advantage among video game players and assessed whether enhanced processing speed can account for this advantage. Experiment 1, using simple colored stimuli, revealed that action video game players demonstrate a similar VSTM advantage over nongamers, regardless of whether they are given limited or ample time to encode items into memory. Experiment 2, using complex shapes as the stimuli to increase the processing demands of the task, replicated this VSTM advantage, irrespective of encoding duration. These findings are inconsistent with a speed-of-processing account of this advantage. An alternative, attentional account, grounded in the existing literature on the visuo-cognitive consequences of video game play, is discussed.},

  abstract = {Scale development and validation are critical to much of the work in the health, social, and behavioral sciences. However, the constellation of techniques required for scale development and evaluation can be onerous, jargon-filled, unfamiliar, and resource-intensive. Further, it is often not a part of graduate training. Therefore, our goal was to concisely review the process of scale development in as straightforward a manner as possible, both to facilitate the development of new, valid, and reliable scales, and to help improve existing ones. To do this, we have created a primer for best practices for scale development in measuring complex phenomena. This is not a systematic review, but rather the amalgamation of technical literature and lessons learned from our experiences spent creating or adapting a number of scales over the past several decades. We identified three phases that span nine steps. In the first phase, items are generated and the validity of their content is assessed. In the second phase, the scale is constructed. Steps in scale construction include pre-testing the questions, administering the survey, reducing the number of items, and understanding how many factors the scale captures. In the third phase, scale evaluation, the number of dimensions is tested, reliability is tested, and validity is assessed. We have also added examples of best practices to each step. In sum, this primer will equip both scientists and practitioners to understand the ontology and methodology of scale development and validation, thereby facilitating the advancement of our understanding of a range of health, social, and behavioral outcomes.},

  abstract = {In this paper we elaborate on the potential of the lmer function from the lme4 package in R for item response (IRT) modeling. In line with the package, an IRT framework is described based on generalized linear mixed modeling. The aspects of the framework refer to (a) the kind of covariates -- their mode (person, item, person-by-item), and their being external vs. internal to responses, and (b) the kind of effects the covariates have -- fixed vs. random, and if random, the mode across which the effects are random (persons, items). Based on this framework, three broad categories of models are described: Item covariate models, person covariate models, and person-by-item covariate models, and within each category three types of more specific models are discussed. The models in question are explained and the associated lmer code is given. Examples of models are the linear logistic test model with an error term, differential item functioning models, and local item dependency models. Because the lme4 package is for univariate generalized linear mixed models, neither the two-parameter, and three-parameter models, nor the item response models for polytomous response data, can be estimated with the lmer function.},

The purposes of this study were: 1) to describe five-repetition STS test (FRSTST) performance (time) by adolescents and adults and 2) to determine the relationship of isometric knee extension strength (force and torque), age, gender, weight, and stature with that performance. Participants were 111 female and 70 male (14-85 years) community-dwelling enrollees in the NIH Toolbox Assessment of Neurological and Behavioral Function. The FRSTST was conducted using a standard armless chair. Knee extension force was measured using a belt-stabilized hand-held dynamometer; knee extension torque was measured using a Biodex dynamometer. The mean times for the FRSTST ranged from 6.0 sec (20-29 years) to 10.8 sec (80-85 years). For both the entire sample and a sub-sample of participants 50-85 years, knee extension strength (r = -0.388 to -0.634), age (r = 0.561 and 0.466), and gender (r = 0.182 and 0.276) were correlated significantly with FRSTST times. In all multiple regression models, knee extension strength provided the best explanation of FRSTST performance, but age contributed as well. Bodyweight and stature were less consistent in explaining FRSTST performance. Gender did not add to the explanation of FRSTST performance. Our findings suggest, therefore, that FRSTST time reflects lower limb strength, but that performance should be interpreted in light of age and other factors.},

Yet theories and findings in experimental psychology either ignore this causal effect heterogeneity or treat it as uninteresting error. This is the case even when data are available to examine effect heterogeneity directly, in within-subjects designs where experimental effects can be examined subject by subject. Using data from four repeated-measures experiments, we show that effect heterogeneity can be modeled readily, that its discovery presents exciting opportunities for theory and methods, and that allowing for it in study designs is good research practice. This evidence suggests that experimenters should work from the assumption that causal effects are heterogeneous. Such a working assumption will be of particular benefit, given the increasing diversity of subject populations in psychology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Although many studies have assumed variability reflects variance caused by exercise training, few studies have examined whether interindividual differences in trainability are present following exercise training. The present individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis sought to: (1) investigate the presence of interindividual differences in trainability for cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), waist circumference, and body mass; and (2) examine the influence of exercise training and potential moderators on the probability that an individual will experience clinically important differences. The IPD meta-analysis combined data from 1879 participants from eight previously published randomized controlled trials. We implemented a Bayesian framework to: (1) test the hypothesis of interindividual differences in trainability by comparing variability in change scores between exercise and control using Bayes factors; and (2) compare posterior predictions of control and exercise across a range of moderators (baseline body mass index (BMI) and exercise duration, intensity, amount, mode, and adherence) to estimate the proportions of participants expected to exceed minimum clinically important differences (MCIDs) for all three outcomes. Bayes factors demonstrated a lack of evidence supporting a high degree of variance attributable to interindividual differences in trainability across all three outcomes. These findings indicate that interindividual variability in observed changes are likely due to measurement error and external behavioural factors, not interindividual differences in trainability. Additionally, we found that a larger proportion of exercise participants were expected to exceed MCIDs compared with controls for all three outcomes. Moderator analyses identified that larger proportions were associated with a range of factors consistent with standard exercise theory and were driven by mean changes. Practitioners should prescribe exercise interventions known to elicit large mean changes to increase the probability that individuals will experience beneficial changes in CRF, waist circumference and body mass.},

The sample effect size value can be misleading because it contains sampling error. Authors often incorrectly interpret the sample effect size as if it were the population effect size. A simple solution to this problem is to report a confidence interval for the population value of the effect size. Standardized linear contrasts of means are useful measures of effect size in a wide variety of research applications. New confidence intervals for standardized linear contrasts of means are developed and may be applied to between-subjects designs, within-subjects designs, or mixed designs. The proposed confidence interval methods are easy to compute, do not require equal population variances, and perform better than the currently available methods when the population variances are not equal.

To optimize these benefits, it would be interesting to evaluate what type of exercise is better. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to assess the effects of heavy-resistance training on mobility and HRQoL in older women. Forty healthy, untrained older women (60-75 years) were randomly assigned to three groups: circuit resistance training (CRT, n = 15), traditional resistance training (TRT, n = 15) or the control group (CG, n = 10). During the 12-week training period, both experimental groups performed training with heavy loads, twice a week. Before and after the training period, the Timed Up and Go test, as a proxy of mobility, and the perception of HRQoL were evaluated. TRT and CRT resulted in a statistically significant improvement in the Timed Up and Go test (-5.4 and -10.3\%, respectively; p {$<$} 0.05), but only the improvement after CRT was significantly greater than changes in the CG (p {$<$} 0.001). Only CRT elicited improvements in several dimensions of the perception of the HRQoL questionnaire, such as: physical functioning (13\%, p {$<$} 0.001), general health (8.1\%; p = 0.048), vitality (17.7\%; p {$<$} 0.001), role emotional (6.7\%; p = 0.044) and physical component summary (6.3\%; p = 0.001). The change in the CRT group was greater than in the CG (p {$<$} 0.001) in the physical functioning score. The present findings show that CRT might be a time- (and hence cost-) effective alternative to trigger multiple positive functional and psychological adaptations in older women.},

Blood lactate samples were taken at the end of each 3-minute stage during the test to determine lactate threshold using 5 traditional methods from blood lactate analysis which were then compared against the WLT predicted value. In a subset of the population (n = 12), repeat trials were performed to determine both inter-reliability and intrareliability of the WLT device. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) found high to very high agreement between the WLT and traditional methods (ICC {$>$} 0.80), with TEMs and mean differences ranging between 3.9-10.2\% and 1.3-9.4\%. Both interdevice and intradevice reliability resulted in highly reproducible and comparable results (CV {$<$} 1.2\%, TEM {$<$}0.2 km{$\cdot$}h, ICC {$>$} 0.97).

While we agree that one does not automatically achieve a conjoint measurement representation upon fitting a Rasch model, we do not agree that the Rasch model could not in principle yield such a representation. In our view, whether this is possible depends on what one is prepared to accept as an empirical relational system. This is a philosophical question that extends beyond the scope of the formal structures advanced in representationalism and psychometrics; a question, moreover, that is not currently settled. We examine some of the ways in which one may react to this question, and conclude that Kyngdon's argument depends on a specific, and perhaps too strong, interpretation of representationalism and psychometric models.},

  abstract = {This article aims to improve theory formation in psychology by developing a practical methodology for constructing explanatory theories: theory construction methodology (TCM). TCM is a sequence of five steps. First, the theorist identifies a domain of empirical phenomena that becomes the target of explanation. Second, the theorist constructs a prototheory, a set of theoretical principles that putatively explain these phenomena. Third, the prototheory is used to construct a formal model, a set of model equations that encode explanatory principles. Fourth, the theorist investigates the explanatory adequacy of the model by formalizing its empirical phenomena and assessing whether it indeed reproduces these phenomena. Fifth, the theorist studies the overall adequacy of the theory by evaluating whether the identified phenomena are indeed reproduced faithfully and whether the explanatory principles are sufficiently parsimonious and substantively plausible. We explain TCM with an example taken from research on intelligence (the mutualism model of intelligence), in which key elements of the method have been successfully implemented. We discuss the place of TCM in the larger scheme of scientific research and propose an outline for a university curriculum that can systematically educate psychologists in the process of theory formation.},

  abstract = {IntroductionIn the now classic essay ``Metaphor'' (Black, 1962b), Max Black considers and rejects various formulations of the ``substitution view'' of metaphor, according to which every metaphorical statement is equivalent to a (perhaps more awkward, or less decorative) literal statement. Black devotes most of his critical attention to a special case of the substitution view, the ``comparison view,'' according to which a metaphor consists in the presentation of an underlying analogy or similarity. It is clear from Black's discussion that he understands the comparison view as entailing that every metaphorical statement be equivalent to one in which some quite definite respect of similarity or analogy is presented, and that successful communication via metaphor involves the hearer understanding the same respect(s) of similarity or analogy as the speaker.Black argues that, except perhaps in cases of catachresis -- the use of metaphor to remedy gaps in vocabulary -- the comparison view is inadequate. As an alternative, Black proposed the adoption of an ``interaction view'' of metaphor. According to this view, metaphors work by applying to the principal (literal) subject of the metaphor a system of ``associated implications'' characteristic of the metaphorical secondary subject. These implications are typically provided by the received ``commonplaces'' about the secondary subject. Although Black's position has many facets, it is clear that, at a minimum, it differs from the comparison view in denying that the success of a metaphor rests on its success in conveying to the listener or reader some quite definite respects of similarity or analogy between the principal and secondary subjects: metaphors are, on Black's view, more open-ended (this is not his terminology) than the comparison view would suggest.},

  abstract = {This paper analyses the psychometric paradigm for understanding educational measurement and standard setting by considering the extent to which that understanding is based on metaphors. I argue that through the metaphors `more is up' and `good is up' we spatialise concepts that are not intrinsically spatial. Human abilities form a distinct conceptual category, with complex and varying rules for the correct usage of different ability terms. The fact that most abilities can be discussed in terms of both `possession' and of `more or less' invites reification, spatialisation, and hence the application of measurement metaphors. Insights into the measurement of abilities can be gained by careful consideration of how ability terms are used in normal discourse, especially of athletic abilities which are partly quantified in terms of attributes that are physically measureable. The fuzziness of natural language creates some of the problems in understanding standards in both psychometrics and physical measurement.},

  abstract = {Some have questioned the evidence for performance-enhancing effects of several substances included on the World Anti-Doping Agency's Prohibited List due to the divergent or inconclusive findings in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). However, inductive statistical inference based on RCTs-only may result in biased conclusions because of the scarcity of studies, inter-study heterogeneity, too few outcome events, or insufficient power. An abductive inference approach, where the body of evidence is evaluated beyond considerations of statistical significance, may serve as a tool to assess the plausibility of performance-enhancing effects of substances by also considering observations and facts not solely obtained from RCTs. Herein, we explored the applicability of an abductive inference approach as a tool to assess the performance-enhancing effects of substances included on the Prohibited List. We applied an abductive inference approach to make inferences on debated issues pertaining to the ergogenic effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO), beta2-agonists and anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS), and extended the approach to more controversial drug classes where RCTs are limited. We report that an abductive inference approach is a useful tool to assess the ergogenic effect of substances included on the Prohibited List---particularly for substances where inductive inference is inconclusive. Specifically, a systematic abductive inference approach can aid researchers in assessing the effects of doping substances, either by leading to suggestions of causal relationships or identifying the need for additional research.},

J Strength Cond Res 30(11): 3261-3265, 2016-The aim of this study was to investigate the test-retest reliability of a novel multijoint isokinetic squat device. The subjects in this study were 10 strength-trained athletes. Each subject completed 3 maximal testing sessions to assess peak concentric and eccentric force (N) over a 3-week period using the Exerbotics squat device. Mean differences between eccentric and concentric force across the trials were calculated. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and coefficients of variation (CVs) for the variables of interest were calculated using an excel reliability spreadsheet. Between trials 1 and 2 an 11.0 and 2.3\% increase in mean concentric and eccentric forces, respectively, was reported. Between trials 2 and 3 a 1.35\% increase in the mean concentric force production and a 1.4\% increase in eccentric force production was reported. The mean concentric peak force CV and ICC across the 3 trials was 10\% (7.6-15.4) and 0.95 (0.87-0.98) respectively. However, the mean eccentric peak force CV and ICC across the trials was 7.2\% (5.5-11.1) and 0.90 (0.76-0.97), respectively. Based on these findings it is suggested that the Exerbotics squat device shows good test-retest reliability. Therefore practitioners and investigators may consider its use to monitor changes in concentric and eccentric peak force.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Weight loss is prescribed to offset the deleterious consequences of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), but a successful intervention requires an accurate assessment of energy requirements. OBJECTIVE: Describe energy requirements in women with PCOS and evaluate common prediction equations compared with doubly labeled water (DLW). DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Academic research center. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-eight weight-stable women with PCOS completed a 14-day DLW study along with measures of body composition and resting metabolic rate and assessment of physical activity by accelerometry. MAIN OUTCOME: Total daily energy expenditure (TDEE) determined by DLW. RESULTS: TDEE was 2661 \textpm{} 373 kcal/d. TDEE estimated from four commonly used equations was within 4\% to 6\% of the TDEE measured by DLW. Hyperinsulinemia (fasting insulin and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance) was associated with TDEE estimates from all prediction equations (both r = 0.45; P = 0.02) but was not a significant covariate in a model that predicts TDEE. Similarly, hyperandrogenemia (total testosterone, free androgen index, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate) was not associated with TDEE. In weight-stable women with PCOS, the following equation derived from DLW can be used to determine energy requirements: TDEE (kcal/d) = 438 - [1.6 * Fat Mass (kg)] + [35.1 * Fat-Free Mass (kg)] + [16.2 * Age (y)]; R2 = 0.41; P = 0.005. CONCLUSIONS: Established equations using weight, height, and age performed well for predicting energy requirements in weight-stable women with PCOS, but more precise estimates require an accurate assessment of physical activity. Our equation derived from DLW data, which incorporates habitual physical activity, can also be used in women with PCOS; however, additional studies are needed for model validation.},

Anthropometry, resting metabolic rate (RMR), selected hormones, and ovarian follicle population were measured pre and post-intervention. Following the 12 week intervention, greater decreases in sum of 2 skinfolds (p = 0.002) and a greater increase in estimated VO2 max (p = 0.017) occurred in the exercise group. Significant decreases in waist girth (p = 0.001) and insulin levels (p = 0.03) occurred in both groups. Hormonal changes were not statistically significant; however, a trend towards an improved hormonal profile, specifically sex-hormone binding globulin (EN, 39\% increase; N, 8\% increase) and lutenizing hormone : follicle-stimulating hormone (LH:FSH) (EN, 9\% decrease; N, 27\% decrease) occurred in the absence of weight loss.

  abstract = {Daniel Kahneman was not the first to suggest that attention and effort are closely associated, but his 1973 book Attention and Effort, which claimed that attention can be identified with effort, cemented the association as a research paradigm in the cognitive sciences. Since then, the paradigm has rarely been questioned and appears to have set the research agenda so that it is self-reinforcing. In this article, we retrace Kahneman's argument to understand its strengths and weaknesses. The central notion of effort is not clearly defined in the book, so we proceed by constructing the most secure inferences we can from Kahneman's argument regarding effort: it is cognitive, objective, metabolic expenditure, and it is attention. Continuing, we find from Kahneman's argument that effort-attention must be a special case of sympathetic dominance of the autonomic nervous system that is also an increase in metabolic activity in the brain that has crossed a threshold of magnitude. We then weigh this conception of effort against evidence in Kahneman's book and against more recent evidence, finding that it does not warrant the conclusion that effort can be equated with attention. In support of an alternative perspective, we briefly review diverse studies of behavior, physiology, and neuroscience on attention and effort, including meditation and studies of the LC-NE system, where we find evidence for the following: (1) Attention seems to be associated not with the utilization of metabolic resources per se but with the readying of metabolic resources in the form of adaptive gain modulation. This occurs under sympathetic dominance and can be experienced as effortful. (2) Attention can also occur under parasympathetic dominance, in which case it is likely to be experienced as effortless.

The concept of a generality of strength adaptation appears less supported in the literature. Objective: To elaborate on recommendations for strength assessment, providing a focus on the ``generality of strength'' and the ``generality of strength adaptation.''Design \& Methods: We reviewed the literature on a generality of strength. In addition, we examined the resistance training lit erature to provide evidence and discussion on a generality of strength adaptation. Results/Conclusions: The generality of strength adaptation, even across strength skills using the same muscle on related movements seems quite low. Although some studies show a weak generality of strength adaptation and others show no generality of strength adaptation, it appears that increases in strength diminish as the strength assessment becomes farther removed from the actual training stimulus.},

  abstract = {There have been calls for more enjoyable Physical Activity (PA) interventions which focus on ensuring a positive affective response. This study explored how using a narrative, characters, and music in a video-led PA session might influence the sense of immersion and impact the affective response. One hundred and thirty-six participants (boys n = 65, girls n = 71) were recruited, 85\% aged between 7 and 11 years old. Participants completed the "Move Like the Avengers" PA video created by Les Mills and Marvel, then complete a survey answering questions on their post activity affective responses, and the use of immersive elements. Positive average affective responses were found (valence mean score: 3.6 \textpm{} 2.2, arousal mean score: 5.1 \textpm{} 1.0). Analysis revealed the narrative with characters indirectly mediate the valence response through creating a sense of immersion ({$\beta$}std = 0.122 [95\%CI 0.013 to 0.231]; p = 0.012). Musical elements had both a direct ({$\beta$}std = 0.449 [95\%CI 0.264 to 0.634]; p {$<$} 0.001), and an indirect ({$\beta$}std = 0.122 [95\%CI 0.014 to 0.229]; p = 0.011) effect upon valence and a direct effect upon arousal ({$\beta$}std = 0.244 [95\%CI 0.006 to 0.482]; p = 0.021). These promising results provide justification for future research into children's immersive PA.},

Thus the present study compared heart rate, energy expenditure, and affective responses in children participating in trampoline park sessions compared with extracurricular sports clubs. METHODS: Children (aged 6-11 years; N.=16 females, N.=10 males) participated in 3 trampoline park sessions and 3 extracurricular sports club sessions lasting \textasciitilde 45 minutes over 3 weeks. Heart rate, energy expenditure, and affective responses through the circumplex model, were measured. RESULTS: Both conditions elicited moderate-vigorous PA. Average heart rate (mean difference [95\%CIs]=27.6 fc [23.5 to 31.8]), peak heart rate (mean difference [95\%CIs]=24.2 fc [20.8 to 27.6]) and energy expenditure (mean difference [95\%CIs]=3.2 kcals.min-1 [2.7 to 3.6]) were all significantly higher for the trampoline sessions. Affective responses for both conditions elicited feelings of "excitement." CONCLUSIONS: Both extracurricular sports clubs and trampoline park activities provide moderate-vigorous PA, though the latter may result in higher heart rate and energy expenditure responses. Both however produce similar positive affective responses. As such, both could be valuable options for PA opportunities for children.},

  abstract = {Physical activity (PA) is considered essential to overall health, yet it is consistently reported that children worldwide are failing to meet the recommended levels. Affective responses are a potential predictor of long-term PA engagement due to their bidirectional relationship with PA. One way to influence the affective response to PA may be to influence the environment in which it takes place; a method of doing this is to immerse children using a narrative with characters. The aim of this research was to compare the effects of using a Disney branded, compared to a non-branded, PA session on children's post activity affective responses and perceived effort of PA. 32 children participated (aged between 4-11 years) and they each completed four sessions of branded activities, and four sessions of unbranded activities. The results showed that children had similar positive affective responses and perceived effort to branded and unbranded activities, and qualitative feedback from parents supported this. However, a secondary finding from qualitative thematic analysis was that parents considered branding a key contributing factor to children's enjoyment and the effort they put into the PA sessions. Future research into influencing the affective response through the environment should carefully consider how to capture this during the activity. Lastly, the research was conducted during the period of the COVID-19 lockdown and so should be interpreted in this context. Conceptual replication outside of this should be an aim of future research.},

For students, university represents a transitional period, including increased independence over lifestyle behaviors, in addition to new stressors and barriers to engaging in PA. It is, therefore, important to monitor PA trends in students to gain a greater understanding about the role it might play in physical and mental well-being, as well as other factors, such as attainment and employability. METHODS: Cross-sectional surveys were conducted in 2016 in Scottish universities and colleges, and in 2017 in universities and colleges across the United Kingdom, and the data were pooled for the present study (N = 11,650). Cumulative ordinal logistic regression was used to model the association between PA levels and mental and personal well-being, social isolation, and perceptions of academic attainment and employability. RESULTS: Only 51\% of the respondents met the recommended levels of moderate to vigorous PA per week. There was a linear relationship between PA levels and all outcomes, with better scores in more active students. CONCLUSIONS: UK university students are insufficiently active compared with the general population of 16- to 24-year olds. Yet, students with higher PA report better outcomes for mental and personal well-being, social isolation, and perceptions of academic attainment and employability.},

METHODS: To help inform this process, a rapid review was performed to identify and describe how other nations are communicating their PA guidelines and PA generally. Elements of the health-enhancing physical activity policy audit tool created by the World Health Organization were used to investigate all 195 countries. RESULTS: Seventy-seven countries had their own guidelines; 53 used the World Health Organization guidelines, and for 65 countries, no guidelines could be found. For the communication, 27 countries used infographics; 56 had government policies/documents, and 11 used a mass media campaign. Only 6 of these had been evaluated. Although many countries used infographics, there were no associated evaluations. As such, any future communication strategies should incorporate an evaluation. Mass media campaigns had the strongest evidence base, proving to be an effective strategy, particularly when incorporating aspects of social marketing. CONCLUSION: This review provides an insight into strategies countries worldwide have taken to communicate PA guidelines and PA promotion. These should be carefully considered when deciding how best to communicate and promote PA guidelines.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe new WHO 2020 guidelines on physical activity and sedentary behaviour. METHODS: The guidelines were developed in accordance with WHO protocols. An expert Guideline Development Group reviewed evidence to assess associations between physical activity and sedentary behaviour for an agreed set of health outcomes and population groups. The assessment used and systematically updated recent relevant systematic reviews; new primary reviews addressed additional health outcomes or subpopulations. RESULTS: The new guidelines address children, adolescents, adults, older adults and include new specific recommendations for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. All adults should undertake 150-300\,min of moderate-intensity, or 75-150\,min of vigorous-intensity physical activity, or some equivalent combination of moderate-intensity and vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity, per week. Among children and adolescents, an average of 60\,min/day of moderate-to-vigorous intensity aerobic physical activity across the week provides health benefits. The guidelines recommend regular muscle-strengthening activity for all age groups. Additionally, reducing sedentary behaviours is recommended across all age groups and abilities, although evidence was insufficient to quantify a sedentary behaviour threshold. CONCLUSION: These 2020 WHO guidelines update previous WHO recommendations released in 2010. They reaffirm messages that some physical activity is better than none, that more physical activity is better for optimal health outcomes and provide a new recommendation on reducing sedentary behaviours. These guidelines highlight the importance of regularly undertaking both aerobic and muscle strengthening activities and for the first time, there are specific recommendations for specific populations including for pregnant and postpartum women and people living with chronic conditions or disability. These guidelines should be used to inform national health policies aligned with the WHO Global Action Plan on Physical Activity 2018-2030 and to strengthen surveillance systems that track progress towards national and global targets.},

  abstract = {The place of induction in the framing and test of scientific hypotheses is investigated. The meaning of 'induction' is first equated with generalization on the basis of case examination. Two kinds of induction are then distinguished: the inference of generals from particulars (first degree induction), and the generalization of generalizations (second degree induction). Induction is claimed to play a role in the framing of modest empirical generalizations and in the extension of every sort of generalizations--not however in the invention of high-level hypotheses containing theoretical predicates. It is maintained, on the other hand, that induction by enumeration is essential in the empirical test of the lowest-level consequences of scientific theories, since it occurs in the drawing of "conclusions" from the examination of empirical evidence. But it is also held that the empirical test is insufficient, and must be supplemented with theorification, or the expansion of isolated hypotheses into theories. Refutation is not viewed as a substitute for confirmation but as its complement, since the very notion of unfavorable case is meaningful only in connection with the concept of positive instance. Although the existence of an inductive method is disclaimed, it is maintained that the various patterns of plausible reasoning (inductive inference included) are worth being investigated. It is concluded that scientific research follows neither the advice of inductivism nor the injunction of deductivism, but takes a middle course in which induction is instrumental both heuristically and methodologically, although the over-all pattern of research is hypothetico-deductive.},

One of these issues is the monotonic increase of the corpus size with time, and the other one is the presence of noise in the textual data. In addition, our method allows to better target the linguistic evolution of the corpus, instead of other aspects like noise fluctuation or topics evolution. A corpus formed by two newspapers ``La Gazette de Lausanne'' and ``Le Journal de Gen\`eve'' is used, providing 4 million articles from 200\,years of archives. We first perform some classical measurements on this corpus in order to provide indicators and visualizations of linguistic evolution. We then define the concept of a lexical kernel and word resilience, to face the two challenges of noises and corpus size fluctuations. This paper ends with a discussion based on the comparison of results from linguistic change analysis and concludes with possible future works continuing in that direction.},

  abstract = {The duration that exercise can be maintained decreases as the power requirements increase. In this review, we describe the power--duration (PD) relationship across the full range of attainable power outputs in humans. We show that a remarkably small range of power outputs is sustainable (power outputs below the critical power, CP). We also show that the origin of neuromuscular fatigue differs considerably depending on the exercise intensity domain in which exercise is performed. In the moderate domain (below the lactate threshold, LT), fatigue develops slowly and is predominantly of central origin (residing in the central nervous system). In the heavy domain (above LT but below CP), both central and peripheral (muscle) fatigue are observed. In this domain, fatigue is frequently correlated with the depletion of muscle glycogen. Severe-intensity exercise (above the CP) is associated with progressive derangements of muscle metabolic homeostasis and consequent peripheral fatigue. To counter these effects, muscle activity increases progressively, as does pulmonary oxygen uptake (), with task failure being associated with the attainment of max. Although the loss of homeostasis and thus fatigue develop more rapidly the higher the power output is above CP, the metabolic disturbance and the degree of peripheral fatigue reach similar values at task failure. We provide evidence that the failure to continue severe-intensity exercise is a physiological phenomenon involving multiple interacting mechanisms which indicate a mismatch between neuromuscular power demand and instantaneous power supply. Valid integrative models of fatigue must account for the PD relationship and its physiological basis.},

METHODS: Eighty-two healthy community-dwelling older adults (71.8 \textpm{} 6.2 yr) performed 11 wk of structured RT (2.5 d{$\cdot$}wk) in treatment groups differing only by the method used to increase training loads. These included percent one repetition maximum (\%1RM): standardized loads based on a percentage of the one repetition maximum (1RM); rating of perceived exertion (RPE): loads increased when perceived difficulty falls below 8/10 on the OMNI-Resistance Exercise Scale perceived exertion scale; repetition maximum (RM): loads increased when a target number of repetitions can be completed with a given load; repetitions in reserve (RiR): identical to RM except subjects must always maintain {$\geq$}1 "repetition in reserve," thus avoiding the possibility of training to temporary muscular failure. RESULTS: Multiple analyses of covariance indicated no significant between-group differences on any strength (chest press 1RM; leg press 1RM) or functional performance outcome (usual walking speed, maximum walking speed, 8-ft timed up-and-go, gallon jug transfer test, 30 s sit-to-stand). The RPE group found the exercise to be significantly more tolerable and enjoyable than subjects in the RiR, RM, and \%1RM groups. CONCLUSION: Given the RM, RPE, \%1RM, and RiR methods appear equally effective at improving muscular strength and functional performance in an older population, we conclude that the RPE method is optimal because it is likely to be perceived as the most tolerable and enjoyable, which are two important factors determining older adults' continued participation in RT.},

  abstract = {Boundary conditions (BC) have long been discussed as an important element in theory development, referring to the ``who, where, when'' aspects of a theory. However, it still remains somewhat vague as to what exactly BC are, how they can or even should be explored, and why their understanding matters. This research tackles these important questions by means of an in-depth theoretical-methodological analysis. The study contributes fourfold to organizational research methods: First, it develops a more accurate and explicit conceptualization of BC. Second, it widens the understanding of how BC can be explored by suggesting and juxtaposing new tools and approaches. It also illustrates BC-exploring processes, drawing on two empirical case examples. Third, it analyzes the reasons for exploring BC, concluding that BC exploration fosters theory development, strengthens research validity, and mitigates the research-practice gap. Fourth, it synthesizes the analyses into 12 tentative suggestions for how scholars should subsequently approach the issues surrounding BC. The authors hope that the study contributes to consensus shifting with respect to BC and draws more attention to BC.},

With a few caveats discussed in this commentary, we agree with Glazier's proposal. However, his ideas suggest that there is a need to demonstrate explicitly how such an integration might occur within applied scientific research. To help fill this perceived `gap' and thereby illustrate the value of adopting a constraints-led approach, we offer an example of our own interdisciplinary research programme. We believe our research on water safety is ideally suited to this task due to the diverse range of interacting constraints present and as such provides a tangible example of how this approach can unify different disciplinary perspectives examining an important aspect of sport performance.},

Although Duhem placed particular emphasis on the perils of thought experiments that Mach had overlooked or at least underestimated, he retained the core idea of Mach's theory, according to which thought experiments cannot break free from the ultimate authority of real-world experiments. This similarity between Duhem's and Mach's views about thought experiments is not the only one. Just as there was in Duhem's criticism of ``exp\'eriences fictives'' a tendency leading him to give voice to one of Mach's basic empiricist claims, so also there was in Mach's interpretation of thought experiments a tendency in the direction of Duhem's conventionalism. If Mach's and Duhem's conceptions of thought experiments are compared, there results an importantly similar, although not identical, tension that should properly be taken into account in the more general comparison between Mach and Duhem.}

Sport and exercise scientists often analyze repeated-measures data, from which mean differences are reported. To aid the interpretation of these data, standardized mean differences (SMD) are commonly reported as a description of effect size. In this manuscript, we hope to alleviate some confusion. First, we provide a philosophical framework for conceptualizing SMDs; that is, by dichotomizing them into two groups: magnitude-based and signal-to-noise SMDs. Second, we describe the statistical properties of SMDs and their implications. Finally, we provide high-level recommendations for how sport and exercise scientists can thoughtfully report raw effect sizes, SMDs, or other effect sizes for their own studies. This conceptual framework provides sport and exercise scientists with the background necessary to make and justify their choice of an SMD.},

However, not all studies, especially those with null findings, make it to formal publication. This publication bias towards positive findings may contribute to questionable research practices. Preregistration is a solution to prevent the publication of distorted evidence resulting from this system. This process asks authors to register their hypotheses and methods before data collection on a publicly available repository or by submitting a Registered Report. In the Registered Report format, authors submit a stage 1 manuscript to a participating journal that includes an introduction, methods, and any pilot data indicating the exploratory or confirmatory nature of the study. After a stage 1 peer review, the manuscript can then be offered in-principle acceptance, rejected, or sent back for revisions to improve the quality of the study. If accepted, the project is guaranteed publication, assuming the authors follow the data collection and analysis protocol. After data collection, authors re-submit a stage 2 manuscript that includes the results and discussion, and the study is evaluated on clarity and conformity with the planned analysis. In its final form, Registered Reports appear almost identical to a typical publication, but give readers confidence that the hypotheses and main analyses are less susceptible to bias from questionable research practices. From this perspective, we argue that inclusion of Registered Reports by researchers and journals will improve the transparency, replicability, and trust in sport and exercise science research.

There is little information, however, about appropriate expectations of students at different stages of schooling. Some progress towards this goal was made by Watson and Callingham (2005), who identified an empirical 6-level hierarchy of statistical literacy and the distribution of middle school students across the levels, using archived data from 1993-2000. There is interest in reconsidering these outcomes a decade later, during which statistics and probability has become a recognised strand of the Australian mathematics curriculum. Using a new data-set of over 7000 student responses from middle-years students in different parts of Australia during the period 2007-2009, the nature of the hierarchy was confirmed. Longitudinal analysis identified how students performed across time against the hierarchy. Suggestions are made for systems and teachers about realistic expectations for middle-years students, and possible curriculum challenges.

Whereas past work has focused on material and emotional costs of empathy, here, we examined whether people experience empathy as cognitively taxing and costly, leading them to avoid it. We developed the empathy selection task, which uses free choices to assess the desire to empathize. Participants make a series of binary choices, selecting situations that lead them to engage in empathy or an alternative course of action. In each of 11 studies (N = 1,204) and a meta-analysis, we found a robust preference to avoid empathy, which was associated with perceptions of empathy as more effortful and aversive and less efficacious. Experimentally increasing empathy efficacy eliminated empathy avoidance, suggesting that cognitive costs directly cause empathy choice. When given the choice to share others' feelings, people act as if it is not worth the effort. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

Einstein considered Bergson's theory of time to be a soft, psychological notion, irreconcilable with the quantitative realities of physics. Bergson, who gained fame as a philosopher by arguing that time should not be understood exclusively through the lens of science, criticized Einstein's theory of time for being a metaphysics grafted on to science, one that ignored the intuitive aspects of time. The Physicist and the Philosopher tells the remarkable story of how this explosive debate transformed our understanding of time and drove a rift between science and the humanities that persists today.Jimena Canales introduces readers to the revolutionary ideas of Einstein and Bergson, describes how they dramatically collided in Paris, and traces how this clash of worldviews reverberated across the twentieth century. She shows how it provoked responses from figures such as Bertrand Russell and Martin Heidegger, and carried repercussions for American pragmatism, logical positivism, phenomenology, and quantum mechanics. Canales explains how the new technologies of the period---such as wristwatches, radio, and film---helped to shape people's conceptions of time and further polarized the public debate. She also discusses how Bergson and Einstein, toward the end of their lives, each reflected on his rival's legacy---Bergson during the Nazi occupation of Paris and Einstein in the context of the first hydrogen bomb explosion.The Physicist and the Philosopher is a magisterial and revealing account that shows how scientific truth was placed on trial in a divided century marked by a new sense of time.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To date no studies have compared resistance training loading strategies combined with dietary intervention for fat loss. Methods: Thus, we performed a randomised crossover design comparing four weeks of heavier- (HL; \textasciitilde 80\% 1RM) and lighter-load (LL; \textasciitilde 60\% 1RM) resistance training, combined with calorie restriction and dietary guidance, including resistance trained participants (n=130; males=49, females=81). Both conditions performed low-volume, (single set of 9 exercises, 2x/week) effort matched (to momentary failure), but non-work-matched protocols. Testing was completed pre- and post-each intervention. Fat mass (kg) was the primary outcome, and a smallest effect size of interest (SESOI) was established at 3.3\% loss of baseline bodyweight. Body fat percentage, lean mass, and strength (7-10RM) for chest press, leg press, and pull-down exercises were also measured. An 8-week washout period of traditional training with normal calorie interspersed each intervention. Results: Both interventions showed small statistically equivalent (within the SESOI) reductions in fat mass (HL: -0.67 kg [95\%CI -0.91 to 0.42]; LL: -0.55 kg [95\%CI -0.80 to -0.31]) which were also equivalent between conditions (HL - LL: -0.113 kg [95\%CI -0.437 kg to 0.212 kg]). Changes in body fat percentage and lean mass were also minimal. Strength increases were small, similar between conditions, and within a previously determined SESOI for the population included (10.1\%). Conclusions: Fat loss reductions are not impacted by resistance training load; both HL and LL produce similar, yet small, changes to body composition over a 4-week intervention. However, the maintenance of both lean mass and strength highlights the value of resistance training during dietary intervention.},

The data were analyzed and reported descriptively with differences {$>$}5\% identified based on the use of a 5-point Likert scale, the sample size, and the nature of the observations. Disparities between the males and females were identified; the males reported higher perceptions of managing effort, technique, and programming without supervision compared to the females. Safety was noted as being more important to the females compared to the males. Qualitatively, additional themes were raised including an analogy of the personal relationship between the trainer and trainee being similar to that between medical professionals and patients. This was validated where the participants discussed their adaptations from supervised strength training for maintaining quality of life in aging and recovering from medical conditions and injury. The data are discussed in the context of a previous body of literature suggesting males falsely report higher levels of confidence in tasks compared to females, particularly in relation to effort, role models, and verbal encouragement. We posit that the greater confidence expressed by males at least partially explains the greater engagement in strength training practices by males compared to females, as well as explaining the higher level of participation in supervised strength training by females compared to males. This research proves beneficial for strength training practitioners in enhancing their understanding and expectations of clients, as well as hopefully proving insightful in engaging more people in strength training.},

  abstract = {A key variable within resistance training (RT) is that of repetition duration: the time (seconds) taken to perform the concentric and eccentric muscle actions of a repetition. Research has produced equivocal results with regard to strength and muscle mass increases; many studies have created parity in the number of repetitions, but there has been disparity in the load used and the time under load (TUL). The purpose of this study was to compare load- and TUL-matched groups performing resistance exercise using different repetition durations. Fifty-nine male and female participants were randomized into 3 groups: 2s:4s (n = 18), 10s:10s (n = 20), or a group that performed 30 s of eccentric, 30 s of concentric, and 30 s of eccentric muscle actions (e.g., 1.5 repetitions; n = 21). Participants were supervised in one-on-one RT sessions 2 days/week for 10 weeks. Outcomes were 10 repetitions maximum (RM) and predicted 1RM for chest press, leg press, and pulldown exercises, as well as body composition, upper arm and thigh muscle mass, and fasted blood glucose. Analyses revealed significant increases in strength for all exercises but no between-group differences and no statistically significant time course changes for the other variables. Repetition duration does not affect the increases in strength in trained participants when exercise is performed to momentary failure. Because time constraints and perceived difficulty are often cited as barriers to exercise, it is important to recognize that the low-volume (single-set), machine-based protocol employed herein produced worthwhile strength increases in trained participants.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Virtual personal training might represent an uncomplicated, accessible, and time-efficient approach to supervised strength training, particularly under government-imposed lockdown or closure of fitness facilities. However, there appears a dearth of literature evaluating the efficacy of virtual personal training. METHODS: The present project considered two studies considering supervised virtual strength training. Study 1 considered trained participants being supervised one-to-one through traditional resistance exercise sessions in a strength training studio (STUD), compared to a virtual personal training protocol performed using bodyweight resistance exercises (VIRT). This study utilized a crossover design whereby male (n~=~13) and female (n~=~7) participants were tested for body composition using BodPod, and strength for bench press, leg press, and high-row exercises. Participants were then randomly assigned to 3-weeks of VIRT or 3-weeks of STUD training. Following each 3-week training period, participants had a 1-week period without training whereby mid-intervention testing occurred, after which participants then completed the alternate training intervention. For study 2, we surveyed the client base of a chain of training facilities that had begun offering virtual personal training during lockdown to explore their views on this approach. RESULTS: Strength and body composition changes were similar between groups, however for neither condition did results surpass the smallest meaningful change. The remaining survey data suggests that supervised virtual resistance training yields similar perceptions of effort, motivation, enjoyment, and supervision quality, compared to traditional supervised studio training. CONCLUSION: Based on the current data, it appears that short-term supervised virtual resistance training is as efficacious as traditional supervised studio-based resistance training.},

  abstract = {The current theory about validity reflected in the Standards for Educational and Psychological Testing (AERA et al. in Standards for educational and psychological testing, American Psychological Association, Washington, DC, 1999), offers no clear indications about the methods for gathering validity evidence about the response processes. Cognitive interviewing (CI) can play an important role answering the current demand about empirical and theoretical analyses of the response processes as a source of validity evidence in psychological testing. CI can provide validity evidence for investigating substantive aspects of construct validity and for contributing to the explanations for item and test scores (Zumbo in Handbook of statistics, vol 26, Elsevier, Amsterdam, pp. 45--79, 2007; The concept of validity: revisions, new directions and applications, IAP---Information Age Publishing Inc., Charlotte, NC, pp. 65--82, 2009). The aim of the study was to illustrate the use of cognitive interviewing method for gathering validity evidence on response processes. The search for evidence about the ``response process'' was guided by an argument-based approach to validity (Kane in Psychological Bulletin 1992; Educational measurement, American Council on Education/Praeger, Washington, DC, pp. 17--64, 2006). 21 cognitive interviews were carried out during the cognitive testing of the APGAR psychological scale intended to measure the ``family support'' construct. Cognitive interviewing provided validity evidence that explains how respondents interpret and respond to the APGAR items. Respondents maintained a shared interpretation of ``family concept'' while answering the APGAR scale items. Nevertheless, they included in the concept of family not only family members they live with but also other family members and even friends. CI participants were also capable of classifying their answers about the family support perception following a polythomous response system. Lastly, the role of CI in the Kane's argument-based approach and Zumbo's contextualized view of validity will be discussed.},

Existing accounts of truthlikeness or verisimilitude address this problem, but are usually limited to the problem of approaching a ``deterministic'' truth by means of deterministic theories. A general theory of truth approximation, however, should arguably cover also cases where either the relevant theories, or ``the truth'', or both, are ``probabilistic'' in nature. As a step forward in this direction, we first present a general characterization of both deterministic and probabilistic truth approximation; then, we introduce a new account of verisimilitude which provides a simple formal framework to deal with such issue in a unified way. The connections of our account with some other proposals in the literature are also briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {The ordered beta regression model is designed explicitly for data with upper and lower bounds, such as survey slider scales, dose/response relationships, and anything that can be considered a proportion or a percentage. This type of data cannot be fit with the standard beta regression model because the beta distribution does not allow for any observations at the bounds, such as a percentage/proportion of 0\% or 100\%. The ordered beta regression model solves this problem by combining the beta distribution with an ordinal distribution over continuous and discrete, or degenerate, observations at the bounds. It is an efficient model that produces intelligible estimates that also respect the bounds of the dependent variable. For more information, I refer you to my paper on the model for more details (also there is an ungated version available here).}

While linguists have consciously borrowed the concept of models from mathematics, they have not been uninfluenced by the use of models in the other sciences and by the various uses in everyday life. Everyday usage usually limits itself to models in the form of 3-dimensional spatial shapes, with or without additional features, such as the power supply used in driving toy models. Two-dimensional diagrams are not commonly called models. A piano arrangement of a symphony ordinarily is not considered a model of the symphony, because it is not in 3-dimensional space, even when in the form of printed music. The other use of models that is mentioned in the chapter is the programmed production processes in industry. Summarizing the usages by linguists and non-linguists, the chapter also provides the lists of synonyms or the characterizations of model and of non-synonyms or notions contrasted with model.},

Understanding the role of NLP in recommender systems is an interesting research area, given the role that social media has played in world events. However, there are few standardized resources which researchers can use to build models that predict engagement with online groups on social media; each research group constructs datasets from scratch without releasing their version for reuse. In this work, we present a dataset drawn from posts and comments on the online message board Reddit. We develop baseline models for recommending subreddits to users, given the user's post and comment history. We also study the behavior of our recommender models on subreddits that were banned in June 2020 as part of Reddit's efforts to stop the dissemination of hate speech.},

The new method consists of calculating the point that yields the maximal distance from a curve representing ventilatory and metabolic variables as a function of oxygen uptake (VO2) to the line formed by the two end points of the curve (Dmax method). Male cyclists (n = 8) performed two incremental exercise tests a week apart. Ventilatory/metabolic variables were measured and blood was sampled for later lactate measurement during each workload and immediately after exercise. No statistical differences were observed in the threshold values (expressed as absolute oxygen uptake; VO2) determined by the Dmax method and the conventional linear regression method (according to O2 equivalent; EqO2) and venous blood at the onset of blood lactate (OBLA), while VT assessed with the conventional linear method (according to the slope of CO2 output; Vslope) yielded significantly lower threshold values. Similar results were obtained from the reproducibility test. Thus, the Dmax method appears to be an objective and reliable method for threshold determination, which can be applied to various ventilatory or metabolic variables yet yield similar results. The results also showed that breathing frequency can be used to determine VT.},

DESIGN: Data analysis of two randomized, controlled exercise trials. SETTING: Community-based research centers. PARTICIPANTS: Overweight and obese (body mass index (BMI){$\geq$}27.0 kg/m2) sedentary men and women aged 65 to 79 (N=95). INTERVENTION: Five months of 4 d/wk of aerobic training (AT, n=40) or 3 d/wk of resistance training (RT, n=55). MEASUREMENTS: Physical function assessments: global measure of lower extremity function (Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB)), 400-m walk, peak aerobic capacity (VO2 peak), and knee extensor strength. RESULTS: On average, both exercise interventions significantly improved physical function. For AT, there was a 7.9\% increase in VO2 peak; individual absolute increases varied from 0.4 to 4.3 mL/kg per minute, and four participants (13\%) showed no change or a decrease in VO2 peak. For RT, knee extensor strength improved an average of 8.1\%; individual increases varied from 1.2 to 63.7 Nm, and 16 participants (30\%) showed no change or a decrease in strength. Usual gait speed, 400-m walk time, chair rise time, and SPPB improved for the majority of AT participants and usual gait speed, chair rise time, and SPPB improved for the majority of RT participants, but there was wide variation in the magnitude of improvement. Only change in 400-m walk time with RT was related to exercise adherence (correlation coefficient=-0.31, P=.004). CONCLUSION: Despite sufficient levels of adherence to both exercise interventions, some participants did not improve function, and the magnitude of improvement varied widely. Additional research is needed to identify factors that optimize responsiveness to exercise to maximize its functional benefits in older adults.},

Performance in the squat jump, the countermovement jump, the Wingate and 1 repetition maximum (1RM) during leg extension, leg curl, and squat tests was recorded just before and 2 weeks after an 8-week course of regular training. For all the subjects, the morning and evening tests were scheduled at the same time of the day as for the morning and evening training sessions. Before training, the results indicated a significant increase in performance from morning to evening tests (ca. 2.84-17.55\% for all tests) for all groups. After training, the diurnal variations in anaerobic performances were blunted in the MTG. In fact, there was no significant difference in muscular power or strength between morning and evening tests. However, these intradaily variations in anaerobic performances persisted in the ETG and CG. From a practical point of view, adaptation to strength training is greater at the time of the day at which training was scheduled than at other times.},

Efforts have focused on whether an abnormal energy homeostasis contributes to the development of obesity in these patients. There are conflicting results in the literature regarding whether women with PCOS have an altered basal metabolic rate (BMR), thereby leading to difficulties in weight loss. The objective of this study is to compare basal metabolic rate (BMR) in women with PCOS and controls. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. PATIENTS: One hundred and twenty-eight PCOS patients diagnosed by original NIH consensus criteria and 72 eumenorrheic, non-hirsute controls were recruited from an academic medical centre. MEASUREMENTS: Assessment of BMR using the InBody portable bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) device and insulin resistance by HOMA-IR indices. RESULTS: PCOS women were younger than controls. As expected, PCOS subjects had higher body mass index (BMI), serum androgens and estimated insulin resistance. After adjusting for age and BMI, there was no significant difference in BMR between PCOS subjects (adjusted mean 5807 kJ/day, 95\% CI 5715-5899) and controls (adjusted mean 5916 kJ/day, 95\% CI 5786-6046) (P = 0{$\cdot$}193). BMR was also comparable in a secondary analysis comparing PCOS women with and without insulin resistance. CONCLUSIONS: After adjusting for age and BMI, there was no difference in BMR between PCOS women and controls.},

  abstract = {A number of professions rely on exercise prescription to improve health or athletic performance, including coaching, fitness/personal training, rehabilitation, and exercise physiology. It is therefore advisable that the professionals involved learn the various tools available for designing effective training programs. Mathematical modeling of athletic training and performance, which we henceforth call ``performance modeling,'' is one such tool. Two models, the critical power (CP) model and the Banister impulse-response (IR) model, offer complementary information. The CP model describes the relationship between work rates and the durations for which an individual can sustain them during constant-work-rate or intermittent exercise. The IR model describes the dynamics by which an individual's performance capacity changes over time as a function of training. Both models elegantly abstract the underlying physiology, and both can accurately fit performance data, such that educating exercise practitioners in the science of performance modeling offers both pedagogical and practical benefits. In addition, performance modeling offers an avenue for introducing mathematical modeling skills to exercise physiology researchers. A principal limitation to the adoption of performance modeling is a lack of education. The goal of this report is therefore to encourage educators of exercise physiology practitioners and researchers to incorporate the science of performance modeling in their curricula and to serve as a resource to support this effort. The resources include a comprehensive review of the concepts associated with the development and use of the models, software to enable hands-on computer exercises, and strategies for teaching the models to different audiences.},

Consequently, a great deal of research has focused on identifying strategies to maintain muscle mass during the aging process and elucidating key molecular pathways of atrophy, with the rationale that the loss of strength is primarily a direct result of the age-associated declines in mass (sarcopenia). However, recent evidence questions this relationship and in this Green Banana article we argue the role of sarcopenia in mediating the age-associated loss of strength (which we will coin as dynapenia) does not deserve the attention it has attracted in both the scientific literature and popular press. Rather, we propose that alternative mechanisms underlie dynapenia (i.e., alterations in contractile properties or neurologic function), and urge that greater attention be paid to these variables in determining their role in dynapenia.},

I argue that this is incorrect: it's not whether or not there is direction from a local theory that matters, but instead how such a theory is used to direct an experiment that matters. Appealing to contemporary exploratory experiments that involve the use of experimental techniques---specifically, examples where scientists explore the interaction of neural activity and human behavior by magnetically stimulating brains---I argue that local theories of a target system can inform auxiliary hypotheses in exploratory experiments, which direct these experiments. These examples illustrate how local theories can direct the exploration of target systems where researchers do not aim to evaluate these theories.},

Thirty-six young men and women were randomly assigned to one of two experimental, parallel groups to complete an 8-week RT programme: One group received direct supervision for their RT sessions (SUP); the other group performed the same RT programme in an unsupervised manner (UNSUP). Programme variables were kept constant between groups. We obtained pre- and post-study assessments of body composition via multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis (MF-BIA), muscle thickness of the upper and lower limbs via ultrasound, 1 repetition maximum (RM) in the back squat and bench press, isometric knee extension strength, and countermovement jump (CMJ) height. Results showed the SUP group generally achieved larger increases in muscle thickness for the triceps brachii, all sites of the rectus femoris, and the proximal region of the vastus lateralis. MF-BIA indicated increases in lean mass favoured SUP. Squat 1RM was greater for SUP; bench press 1RM and isometric knee extension were similar between conditions. CMJ increases modestly favoured UNSUP. In conclusion, our findings suggest that supervised RT promotes greater muscular adaptations and enhances exercise adherence in young, resistance-trained individuals.},

  abstract = {Chronic pain is one of the most disabling medical conditions globally, yet, to date, we lack a satisfying theoretical framework for research and clinical practice. Over the prior decades, several frameworks have been presented with biopsychosocial models as the most promising. However, in translation to clinical practice, these models are often applied in an overly reductionist manner, leaving much to be desired. In particular, they often fail to characterize the complexities and dynamics of the lived experience of chronic pain. Recently, an enactive, affordance-based approach has been proposed, opening up new ways to view chronic pain. This model characterizes how the persistence of pain alters a person's field of affordances: the unfolding set of action possibilities that a person perceives as available to them. The affordance-based model provides a promising perspective on chronic pain as it allows for a systematic investigation of the interactive relation between patients and their environment, including characteristic alterations in the experience of their bodies and the space they inhabit. To help bridge the gap from philosophy to clinical practice, we unpack in this paper the core concepts of an affordance-based approach to chronic pain and their clinical implications, highlighting aspects that have so far received insufficient attention. We do so with an analogy to playing video games, as we consider such comparative illustration a useful tool to convey the complex concepts in an affordance-based model and further explore central aspects of the lived experience of chronic pain.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Strength and endurance tests are important for both clinical practice and research due to the key role they play in musculoskeletal function. In particular, deconditioning of the lumbar extensor musculature has been associated with low back pain (LBP). Due to the relationship between strength and absolute endurance, it is possible that trunk extension (TEX) endurance tests could provide a proxy measure of isolated lumbar extension (ILEX) strength and thus represent a simple, practical alternative to ILEX measurements. Though, the comparability of TEX endurance and ILEX strength is presently unclear and so the aim of the present study was to examine this relationship. METHODS: Thirty eight healthy participants and nineteen participants with non-specific chronic LBP and no previous lumbar surgery participated in this cross-sectional study design. TEX endurance was measured using the Biering-Sorensen test. A maximal ILEX strength test was performed on the MedX lumbar-extension machine. RESULTS: A Pearson's correlation revealed no relationship between TEX endurance and ILEX strength in the combined group (r = 0.035, p = 0.793), the chronic LBP group (r = 0.120, p = 0.623) or the asymptomatic group (r = -0.060, p = 0.720). CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that TEX is not a good indicator of ILEX and cannot be used to infer results regarding ILEX strength. However, a combination of TEX and ILEX interpreted together likely offers the greatest and most comprehensive information regarding lumbo-pelvic function during extension.},

OBJECTIVE: To compare isolated lumbar extension strength between healthy asymptomatic participants and participants with chronic low back pain (CLBP), while controlling for previous lumbar spine surgery. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Deconditioning of the lumbar musculature is common in those with previous lumbar surgery, resulting in decreased strength and endurance. Evidence is required to support whether this is the case for participants with CLBP yet no previous surgery compared with asymptomatic participants. METHODS: Forty-two healthy (25 males and 17 females) asymptomatic participants, and 53 participants with non-specific CLBP (30 males and 23 females) aged between 19 and 76 years were recruited. Maximal isometric isolated lumbar extension (ILEX) strength was examined. RESULTS: A Mann-Whitney U test indicated that ILEX strength was significantly greater in the asymptomatic group compared with the CLBP group (Z{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}1441.00, P{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.014). Post-hoc effect size was calculated to be d{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.56, showing a moderate effect. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that ILEX weakness and lumbar extensor deconditioning is present independent of surgery and may be a factor involved in CLBP. As such, lumbar extensor deconditioning would appear to be a reasonable target for interventions in CLBP. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: 3.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with disordered eating/eating disorders, but prior meta-analyses are limited by small numbers. OBJECTIVE: To inform the 2023 International PCOS Guideline, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the prevalence of disordered eating/eating disorders among women with and without PCOS. METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycInfo, and All EMB were searched from inception through February 1, 2024, for studies that compared prevalences of eating disordered/disordered eating in adolescent or adult women. Random effects meta-analyses were used to estimate the pooled odds ratios (OR) or standardized mean differences (SMD) of outcomes in women with PCOS compared to controls. Methodological quality was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system, and included studies were assessed for risk of bias. RESULTS: Of 1352 articles identified, 20 were included, with a total of 28 922 women with PCOS and 258 619 controls. Individuals with PCOS had higher odds of any eating disorder (OR: 1.53 [1.29, 1.82], 8 studies), which persisted in studies where PCOS was diagnosed by Rotterdam criteria (OR: 2.88 [1.55, 5.34], 4 studies). Odds of bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, and disordered eating, but not anorexia nervosa, were increased in PCOS. Mean disordered eating scores were higher in PCOS (SMD: 0.52 [0.28, 0.77], 13 studies), including when stratified by normal and higher weight body mass index. Most included studies were of moderate quality, with no evidence of publication bias. CONCLUSION: Our study informs the 2023 PCOS Guideline recommendations for consideration of the risk of disordered eating/ eating disorders in care of women with PCOS, regardless of weight, especially during providing lifestyle counseling.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death in the world and arterial hypertension (AH) accounts for 13.8\% of deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases. Strength training interventions could be an important alternative tool for blood pressure control, however, consistent evidence and the most effective training protocol for this purpose are yet to be established. The current study used the Cochrane methodology to systematically review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effect of strength training on blood pressure in hypertensive patients. A systematic search was conducted in the PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and World Health Organization databases. This review included controlled trials that evaluated the effect of strength training for 8~weeks or more in adults with arterial hypertension, published up to December 2020. Data are described and reported as the weighted mean difference of systolic and diastolic pressure and a 95\% confidence interval. Protocol registration: PROSPERO registration number CRD42020151269. A total of 14 studies were identified, including a combined total of 253 participants with hypertension. The meta-analysis showed that mean values of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) decreased significantly after strength training interventions. The strongest effect of strength training on decreasing blood pressure was observed in protocols with a moderate to vigorous load intensity ({$>$}\,60\% of one-repetition maximum-1RM), a frequency of at least 2 times per week, and a minimum duration of 8~weeks. We concluded that strength training interventions can be used as a non-drug treatment for arterial hypertension, as they promote significant decreases in blood pressure.},

This paper aims to examine how weak the metaphysical commitments endorsed by scientific realists could be. I will argue that scientific realism could be stated without accepting any form of metaphysical realism. Such a conclusion does not go as far as to try to combine scientific realism with metaphysical antirealism. Instead, it amounts to the combination of the former with a weaker view, called quietism, which is agnostic on the existence of mind-independent structures. In Sect.~2, I will argue that the minimal claim that brings together every scientific realist view is devoid of any metaphysical commitment. In Sect.~3, I will define metaphysical realism and antirealism. Such work will be instrumental in providing a more precise statement of quietism. Finally (Sect.~4), I will argue that assuming quietism, it is still possible to make sense of the debate between scientific realists and antirealists.},

Twenty-two detrained men (23.3\textpm 4.1 years) were randomly allocated to the following groups: a group that performed the same exercises in all training sessions (N-VAR=11) or one that varied the exercises for the same muscle groups (VAR=11). All were submitted to 3 weekly sessions for nine weeks. Muscle thickness was assessed at the proximal, middle, and distal sites of the lateral and anterior thigh, elbow flexors, and extensors by B-mode ultrasound. The VAR group significantly increased all the sites analyzed (P{$<$}0.05). Furthermore, the proximal site of the lateral thigh showed a larger relative increase when compared to the middle site (P{$<$}0.05). In contrast, the N-VAR group were not revealed significant improvements only for the middle site of the lateral thigh and the proximal site of the elbow flexors (P{$>$}0.05). Our results suggest that to perform different resistance exercises can induce hypertrophy of all sites assessed in detrained young men.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the level of scientific evidence and the place in the rehabilitation framework of isokinetic muscle strengthening (IMS) for knee osteoarthritis (OA). METHODS: A systematic review of the English literature in MEDLINE via PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and PEDro databases for only randomized comparative trials. Data that were sufficiently homogeneous underwent comprehensive meta-analysis. Methodological assessment was done by using the CLEAR scale for non-pharmacologic trials. RESULTS: We identified articles for 9 trials (696 patients). All trials were of low to moderate quality. Tolerance of IMS was considered good. Improvement in muscle strength was better with an IMS program than no treatment or an isometric exercise but did not differ with an aerobic program. We found an important effect for pain (standardized mean difference 1.218 [95\% CI 0.899-1.54], P{$<$}0.001) and functional Lequesne index (1.61 [0.40-2.81], P=0.009) and a moderate effect for the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index subscore C for disability (0.58 [0.04-1.11], P=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: IMS is an effective way to propose dynamic muscle strengthening for knee OA rehabilitation and has a significant effect on pain and disability. Because of the weak methodology and the great heterogeneity of studies, particularly in IMS protocol and outcome measures, insufficient data are available to provide guidelines about efficacy and strategy. Future clinical trials are needed, but more attention should be paid to the methods of such studies to clarify the role of IMS in the therapeutic armamentarium of knee OA.},

Written for researchers and students -- particularly in psychological science -- it highlights and introduces seven topics: understanding open science; open access; open data, materials, and code; reproducible analyses; preregistration and registered reports; replication research; and teaching open science. For each topic, we provide a detailed summary of one particularly informative and actionable article and suggest several further resources. Supporting a broader understanding of open science issues, this overview should enable researchers to engage with, improve, and implement current open, transparent, reproducible, replicable, and cumulative scientific practices.

First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

  abstract = {Quantitative integration of the literature on the effect of elevated CO2 on woody plants is important to aid our understanding of forest health in coming decades and to better predict terrestrial feedbacks on the global carbon cycle. We used meta-analytic methods to summarize and interpret more than 500 reports of effects of elevated CO2 on woody plant biomass accumulation and partitioning, gas exchange, and leaf nitrogen and starch content. The CO2 effect size metric we used was the log-transformed ratio of elevated compared to ambient response means weighted by the inverse of the variance of the log ratio. Variation in effect size among studies was partitioned according to the presence of interacting stress factors, length of CO2 exposure, functional group status, pot size, and type of CO2 exposure facility. Both total biomass (W T) and net CO2 assimilation (A) increased significantly at about twice ambient CO2, regardless of growth conditions. Low soil nutrient availability reduced the CO2 stimulation of W T by half, from +31\% under optimal conditions to +16\%, while low light increased the response to +52\%. We found no significant shifts in biomass allocation under high CO2. Interacting stress factors had no effect on the magnitude of responses of A to CO2, although plants grown in growth chambers had significantly lower responses (+19\%) than those grown in greenhouses or in open-top chambers (+54\%). We found no consistent evidence for photosynthetic acclimation to CO2 enrichment except in trees grown in pots {$<$}0.5\,l (-36\%) and no significant CO2 effect on stomatal conductance. Both leaf dark respiration and leaf nitrogen were significantly reduced under elevated CO2 (-18\% and -16\% respectively, data expressed on a leaf mass basis), while leaf starch content increased significantly except in low nutrient grown gymnosperms. Our results provide robust, statistically defensible estimates of elevated CO2 effect sizes against which new results may be compared or for use in forest and climate model parameterization.},

  abstract = {The purpose of the study was to quantify and compare the volume of training performed by competitive physique athletes, obtaining unprecedented findings at this level of specificity given the scarce specific literature and comparing with guidelines, in order to generate more specific and accurate conducts in the future.MethodsOne hundred and fifty-four athletes from different federations and categories were analyzed using questions with items about training strategies describing them and subsequently comparing them with each other and with guidelines.ResultsMany of the categories reduced training volume in pr\'e-contest for most muscle groups. There is a variation in the average number of workouts per week between the off-season and the pr\'e-contest period in different muscle groups. There was a significant difference in the weekly sets volume in categories (p {$<$} 0.05, {$\alpha$} = 0,05): Men's Physique (MP) reduced (pectoral); Classic Physique (CP) and MP reduced (deltoids); Bodybuilding Classic (BC) vs. MP (pectoral) off-season and BC vs. MP (deltoids) off-season; Master (MT) increased (quadriceps); BC and MT increased (abdominals); CP vs. MP pr\'e-contest (triceps surae). There was a significant increase in the duration of cardio work in pr\'e-contest: CP, BC, Bikini (BK), and Wellness (WL) (p {$<$} 0.05, {$\alpha$} = 0,05). An increase was observed as statistically significant in the weekly frequency of BC and Senior (SN) (p {$<$} 0.05). In most cases, there was an increase in the amount of cardio work during the pr\'e-contest period.ConclusionNotable reductions in training volume were observed during the pr\'e-contest period for some muscle groups. Both men and women exhibited a decrease in exercise frequency for some muscle groups during pr\'e-contest, alongside an increase in cardio training. We suggest new studies that can help with developing more detailed training practices for physique athletes.},

  abstract = {The lactate threshold (LT) represents the onset of a metabolic acidosis during graded exercise testing (GXT). It is a valuable measurement in clinical exercise testing and correlates well with endurance performance. Our purpose was to compare three LT detection methods, namely, Inspection (work rate at onset of a systematic increase in blood lactate concentration determined by inspection of blood lactate versus work rate plot), 0.5 mM (work rate which just precedes a rise in blood lactate concentration of {$>$}0.5 mM) and log-log (work rate at the intersection of two linear lines in plot of log lactate versus log work rate where the residual sum of squares for both lines added together is minimized). Fourteen subjects underwent cycle ergometer GXT with blood samples obtained at the end of each 3-min work rate increment and analysed for lactate concentration. The mean +/- 95\% confidence limits of work rates at LT for the Inspection, 0.5 mM and log-log methods were 104.5 +/- 28.0, 103.2 +/- 28.1 and 105.1 +/- 27.3 W, respectively. Repeated-measures analysis of variance yielded a non-significant F ratio. The Bland-Altman bias +/- 95\% limits of agreement for Inspection versus 0.5 mM, Inspection versus log-log and 0.5 mM versus log-log were 1.3 +/- 20.6, -0.6 +/- 12.5 and -1.9 +/- 20.5 W, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficients for Inspection versus 0.5 mM, Inspection versus log-log and 0.5 mM versus log-log were 0.978, 0.992 and 0.977, respectively. The results of this study suggest that all three methods detect the LT at the same work rate.},

Outcome measures included validated questionnaires reporting on body image concerns. Methodological quality was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) system, and included studies were assessed for risk of bias. Meta-analyses were performed using the inverse variance method based on random or fixed effects models (Review Manager, Version 5). RESULTS: A total of 918 women with PCOS and 865 women without PCOS from 9 studies were included. Meta-analysis of 3 studies using Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire Appearance Scale (MBSRQ-AS) showed those with PCOS reported higher dissatisfaction with appearance evaluation and appearance orientation compared to those without PCOS (mean difference [MD] = -0.78, I2 = 0\%, P {$<$} .00001, and MD = 0.22, I2 = 54\%, P = .004, respectively). Meta-analysis of 2 studies showed higher dissatisfaction with overweight preoccupation, lower body area satisfaction, and body weight classification on MBSRQ-AS subscales in those with PCOS compared to those without PCOS (all P {$<$} .001). Meta-analysis of 2 studies using the Body Esteem Scale for Adolescents and Adults (BESAA) showed significantly lower scores for the weight subscale in those with PCOS compared to those without PCOS (P = .03). CONCLUSIONS: Those with PCOS experience more significant body image concerns, emphasising the importance of awareness in the clinical care of PCOS. Considering the limited evidence, further studies are warranted to identify drivers and mitigating factors.},

  abstract = {Objective: To quantify the effects of acute hypoxic exposure on exercise capacity and performance, which includes continuous and intermittent forms of exercise. Design: A systematic review was conducted with a three-level mixed effects meta-regression. The ratio of means method was used to evaluate main effects and moderators providing practical interpretations with percentage change. Data sources: A systemic search was performed using three databases (Google scholar, PubMed and SPORTDiscus). Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: Inclusion was restricted to investigations that assessed exercise performance (time trials (TTs), sprint and intermittent exercise tests) and capacity (time to exhaustion test, TTE) with acute hypoxic ({$<$}24 h) exposure and a normoxic comparator. Results: Eighty-two outcomes from 53 studies (N = 798) were included in this review. The results show an overall reduction in exercise performance/capacity -17.8 \textpm{} 3.9\% (95\% CI -22.8\% to -11.0\%), which was significantly moderated by -6.5 \textpm{} 0.9\% per 1000 m altitude elevation (95\% CI -8.2\% to -4.8\%) and oxygen saturation (-2.0 \textpm{} 0.4\%; 95\% CI -2.9\% to -1.2\%). TT (-16.2 \textpm{} 4.3\%; 95\% CI -22.9\% to -9\%) and TTE (-44.5 \textpm{} 6.9\%; 95\% CI -51.3\% to -36.7\%) elicited a negative effect, whilst indicating a quadratic relationship between hypoxic magnitude and both TTE and TT performance. Furthermore, exercise less than 2 min exhibited no ergolytic effect from acute hypoxia.Summary/Conclusion: This review highlights the ergolytic effect of acute hypoxic exposure, which is curvilinear for TTE and TT performance with increasing hypoxic levels, but short duration intermittent and sprint exercise seem to be unaffected.},

Twenty young men with at least 2 years of experience in RT were randomized in 2 groups: MJ+SJ (n = 10; age, 27.7 \textpm{} 6.6 years) and MJ (n = 10; age, 29.4 \textpm{} 4.6 years). Both groups trained for 8 weeks following a linear periodization model. Measures of elbow flexors and extensors 1-repetition maximum (1RM), flexed arm circumference (FAC), and arm muscle circumference (AMC) were taken pre- and post-training period. Both groups significantly increased 1RM for elbow flexion (4.99\% and 6.42\% for MJ and MJ+SJ, respectively), extension (10.60\% vs 9.79\%, for MJ and MJ+SJ, respectively), FAC (1.72\% vs 1.45\%, for MJ and MJ+SJ, respectively), and AMC (1.33\% vs 3.17\% for MJ and MJ+SJ, respectively). Comparison between groups revealed no significant difference in any variable. In conclusion, 8 weeks of RT involving MJ or MJ+SJ resulted in similar alterations in muscle strength and size in trained participants. Therefore, the addition of SJ exercises to a RT program involving MJ exercises does not seem to promote additional benefits to trained men, suggesting MJ-only RT to be a time-efficient approach.},

Age-related bone loss involves a gradual and progressive decline, which is also seen in men. Markedly increased bone resorption leads to the initial fall in bone mineral density. With increasing age, there is also a significant reduction in bone formation. This is mostly due to a shift from osteoblastogenesis to predominant adipogenesis in the bone marrow, which also has a lipotoxic effect that affects matrix formation and mineralization. We review new evidence on the pathophysiology of age-related bone loss with emphasis upon the mechanism of action of current osteoporosis treatments. New potential treatments are also considered, including therapeutic approaches to osteoporosis in the elderly that focus on the pathophysiology and potential reversal of adipogenic shift in bone.},

In many fields, including sport and exercise science, exploratory research is not openly reported, a practice that leads to serious problems. At the same time, exploration is a crucial step in scientific knowledge generation, and a substantial proportion of studies will be exploratory in nature, or include both confirmatory and exploratory analyses. Using a flowchart, we review how data are typically collected and used, and we distinguish exploratory from confirmatory studies by arguing that data-driven analyses, where the Type I and Type II error cannot be controlled, is what characterises exploratory research. We ask which factors increase the quality and value of exploratory analyses, and highlight large sample sizes, uncommon sample compositions, rigorous data collection, widely used measures, observing a logical and coherent pattern across multiple variables, and the potential for generating new research questions as the main factors. Finally, we provide guidelines for carrying out and transparently writing up an exploratory study.},

We studied body composition, insulin sensitivity, and resting energy expenditure in 14 PCOS patients (6 obese and 8 nonobese) compared to 10 matched nonobese non-PCOS subjects. Insulin sensitivity was assessed using the gold standard 80\,mU/m(2)/min euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp and resting energy expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry. Results. Insulin sensitivity adjusted to lean mass was lowest in obese PCOS subjects and highest in healthy subjects (11.2 [10.1-12.4] versus 12.9 [12.1-13.8] versus 16.6 [13.8-17.9], p = 0.012); there was a tendency for resting energy expenditure adjusted for total body mass to decrease across the groups highest in obese PCOS subjects (1411 [1368-1613] versus 1274 [1174-1355] versus 1239 [1195-1454], p = 0.306). Conclusion. In this sub-Saharan population, insulin resistance is associated with PCOS per se but is further aggravated by obesity. Obesity did not seem to be explained by low resting energy expenditure suggesting that dietary intake may be a determinant of the obesity in this context.},

  abstract = {The explanation of psychological phenomena is a central aim of psychological science. However, the nature of explanation and the processes by which we evaluate whether a theory explains a phenomenon are often unclear. Consequently, it is often unknown whether a given psychological theory indeed explains a phenomenon. We address this shortcoming by characterizing the nature of explanation in psychology, and proposing a framework in which to evaluate explanation. We present a productive account of explanation: a theory putatively explains a phenomenon if and only if a formal model of the theory produces the statistical pattern representing the phenomenon. Using this account, we outline a workable methodology of explanation: (a) explicating a verbal theory into a formal model, (b) representing phenomena as statistical patterns in data, and (c) assessing whether the formal model produces these statistical patterns. In addition, we explicate three major criteria for evaluating the goodness of an explanation (precision, robustness, and empirical relevance), and examine some cases of explanatory breakdowns. Finally, we compare our proposal to other models of explanation from philosophy of science and discuss how our model contributes to constructing and developing psychological theories with high explanatory power.},

  abstract = {Traditional Rasch estimation of the item and student parameters via marginal maximum likelihood, joint maximum likelihood or conditional maximum likelihood, assume individuals in clustered settings are uncorrelated and items within a test that share a grouping structure are also uncorrelated. These assumptions are often violated, particularly in educational testing situations, in which students are grouped into classrooms and many test items share a common grouping structure, such as a content strand or a reading passage. Consequently, one possible approach is to explicitly recognize the clustered nature of the data and directly incorporate random effects to account for the various dependencies.  This article demonstrates how the multilevel Rasch model can be estimated using the functions in R for mixed-effects models with crossed or partially crossed random effects. We demonstrate how to model the following hierarchical data structures: a) individuals clustered in similar settings (e.g., classrooms, schools), b) items nested within a particular group (such as a content strand or a reading passage), and c) how to estimate a teacher x content strand interaction.},

This knowledge offers a wide range of opportunities for application in ecological research and natural resource decision-making. While experts are often consulted ad-hoc, their contributions are not widely acknowledged. These informal applications of expert knowledge lead to concerns about a lack of transparency and repeatability, causing distrust of this knowledge source in the scientific community. Here, we address these concerns with an exploration of the diversity of expert knowledge and of rigorous methods in its use. The effective use of expert knowledge hinges on an awareness of the spectrum of experts and their expertise, which varies by breadth of perspective and critical assessment. Also, experts express their knowledge in different forms depending on the degree of contextualization with other information. Careful matching of experts to application is therefore essential and has to go beyond a simple fitting of the expert to the knowledge domain. The standards for the collection and use of expert knowledge should be as rigorous as for empirical data. This involves knowing when it is appropriate to use expert knowledge and how to identify and select suitable experts. Further, it requires a careful plan for the collection, analysis and validation of the knowledge. The knowledge held by expert practitioners is too valuable to be ignored. But only when thorough methods are applied, can the application of expert knowledge be as valid as the use of empirical data. The responsibility for the effective and rigorous use of expert knowledge lies with the researchers.},

  abstract = {The determination of a cyclist's lactate threshold (LT) has become an important test performed in sports science laboratories around the world. A limitation of such testing is that it is relatively expensive and invasive, requiring multiple blood samples. The purpose of the current study was to evaluate a commercially available, wearable lactate threshold sensor (WLT) that uses near infrared LED technology to measure gastrocnemius muscle oxygenation and predict LT. The WLT was compared to four traditional calculations of determining LT following an incremental exercise test. Ten male and five female recreational to elite cyclists (mean~\textpm ~SD; age 24~\textpm ~8, body mass 69.7~\textpm ~7.3~kg, VO2max; 59.7~\textpm ~9.9~ml~kg-1~min-1) performed an incremental cycling test to exhaustion. Blood lactate samples were taken at the end of each 3-min stage during the test to determine lactate threshold using four traditional methods (TradLT, Dmax, mDmax, OBLA). Traditional methods were then compared against the WLT predicted value. The correlation between the WLT and TradLT, Dmax, mDmax and OBLA were all~{$>$}r~=~0.96. The highest level of agreement for the WLT was with the Dmax method (95~\% limits of agreement: \textpm 17~W, TEE~=~8.6~W, 4.4~\%). The 95~\% level of agreement between the WLT and all other traditional methods was {$<\pm$}40~W (TEE~{$<$}18~W, 8~\%). In summary, the WLT is practical, easy to use and exhibits an acceptable level of agreement with four of the traditionally accepted methods of determining lactate threshold.},

  abstract = {Some research suggests that strength improvements are greater when resistance training continues to the point at which the individual cannot perform additional repetitions (i.e., repetition failure). Performing additional forced repetitions after the point of repetition failure and thus further increasing the set volume is a common resistance training practice. However, whether short-term use of this practice increases the magnitude of strength development with resistance training is unknown and was investigated here. Twelve basketball and 10 volleyball players trained 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks, completing either 4 x 6, 8 x 3, or 12 x 3 (sets x repetitions) of bench press per training session. Compared with the 8 x 3 group, the 4 x 6 protocol involved a longer work interval and the 12 x 3 protocol involved higher training volume, so each group was purposefully designed to elicit a different number of forced repetitions per training session. Subjects were tested on 3- and 6-repetition maximum (RM) bench press (81.5 +/- 9.8 and 75.9 +/- 9.0 kg, respectively, mean +/- SD), and 40-kg Smith Machine bench press throw power (589 +/- 100 W). The 4 x 6 and 12 x 3 groups had more forced repetitions per session (p {$<$} 0.01) than did the 8 x 3 group (4.1 +/- 2.6, 3.1 +/- 3.5, and 1.2 +/- 1.8 repetitions, respectively), whereas the 12 x 3 group performed approximately 40\% greater work and had 30\% greater concentric time. As expected, all groups improved 3RM (4.5 kg, 95\% confidence limits, 3.1- 6.0), 6RM (4.7 kg, 3.1-6.3), bench press throw peak power (57 W, 22-92), and mean power (23 W, 4-42) (all p {$<$} or = 0.02). There were no significant differences in strength or power gains between groups. In conclusion, when repetition failure was reached, neither additional forced repetitions nor additional set volume further improved the magnitude of strength gains. This finding questions the efficacy of adding additional volume by use of forced repetitions in young athletes with moderate strength training experience.},

Studies 1 and 2 revealed that people provide self-serving assessments to the extent that the trait is ambiguous, that is, to the extent that it can describe a wide variety of behaviors. Study 3 more directly implicated ambiguity in these appraisals. As the number of criteria that Ss could use in their evaluations increased, Ss endorsed both positive and negative characteristics as self-descriptive to a greater degree. Study 4 demonstrated that the evidence and criteria that people use in self-evaluations is idiosyncratic. Asking Ss explicitly to list the evidence and criteria they considered before providing self-evaluations did not influence their self-appraisals. However, requiring Ss to evaluate themselves using a list generated by another individual caused them to lower their self-appraisals. Discussion centers on the normative status of these self-serving appraisals, and on potential consequences for social judgment in general.

Five studies revealed that participants who differed in their self-ratings along trait dimensions also tended to associate different behaviors and performances with those traits. For example, participants who described themselves as dominant tended to emphasize desirable over undesirable behaviors and characteristics in their definitions of the trait, whereas self-described nondominants highlighted the opposite. Participants' self-ratings on dominance were also influenced by making positive or negative examples of dominant behavior salient to them. Moreover, when participants were induced to shift self-descriptions in self-serving ways, they tended to do so by revising their prototype of the trait in question. Discussion centers on the implications of these findings for the prediction of behavior and the interpretation of some social science results.

Through letters, arguments, and commentaries on significant debates, Durkheim confronted critics, clarified his own position, and defended the objective scientific method he applied to his study of humans. This updated edition offers an introduction and extra notes as well as a new translation to improve the clarity and accessibility of this essential work. In the introduction, Steven Lukes, author of the definitive biography Emile Durkheim: His Life and Work, spells out Durkheim's intentions, shows the limits of Durkheim's view of sociology, and presents its political background and significance. Making use of the various texts in this volume and Durkheim's later work, Lukes discusses how Durkheim's methodology was modified or disregarded in practice--and how it is still relevant today. With substantial notes on context, this user-friendly edition will greatly ease the task of students and scholars working with Durkheim's method--a view that has been a focal point of sociology since its original publication.

J Strength Cond Res 34(2): 587-601, 2020-Angular isokinetic dynamometry (AID) is widely regarded as the gold standard for dynamic muscle performance testing. Based on the rotational movement of its actuator, AID targets "single-joint" (knee, shoulder, hip, etc.) configurations namely measurement of muscle potential while it moves the lever arm-limb assembly ostensibly around a single fixed axis. On the other hand, the application of multiple-joint isokinetic dynamometry (MID) is relatively narrow, both in research and in practice. This situation is due, possibly, to the fact that these dynamometers are generally more limited in scope namely to testing/conditioning of combined hip, knee, ankle motion (leg press), combined shoulder, elbow motion, and lifting motion patterns, despite the fact that all 3 are associated with higher functionality. However, with the emerging importance of MID, this critical review takes a fresh look at its various aspects including the terminology and classification of multiple-joint isokinetic dynamometers; the problem of scaling namely the need to adjust the range of motion and linear velocities to subjective anthropometric measures; specific technical and methodological issues that underlie the valid application of these dynamometers; available reference values; and the reproducibility of MID-based test findings. Analysis of these topics indicates that MID may validly and effectively be applied for the assessment and conditioning of specific muscle action patterns. However, there is a clear need for standardization of tests and for conditioning protocols alongside research into the use of this method in various clinical cohorts.},

  abstract = {Purpose: To determine whether kinetic chain pattern during knee extensor strength training influences quadriceps femoris center of mass and moment of inertia about the hip in a predictable manner as such changes can affect running economy. Methods: Twelve participants completed 8 weeks of both unilateral open (OKC) and closed (CKC) kinetic chain resistance training on opposing legs. Changes in quadriceps femoris muscle volume (VOL QF ), center of mass location (CoM QF ), and moment of inertia ( I QF ) about the hip were determined from magnetic resonance images scans. Regional hemodynamics of the vastus lateralis taken at 30\% and 70\% of muscle length during OKC and CKC bouts early in the training program were measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and used post hoc to predict changes in CoM QF . Results: While increases in VOL QF were similar between OKC ({$\Delta$}79.5 \textpm{} 87.9 cm 3 ) and CKC ({$\Delta$}60.2 \textpm{} 110.5 cm 3 , p = 0.29), the patterns of hypertrophy differed; a distal shift in CoM QF ({$\Delta$}2.4 \textpm{} 0.4 cm, p \&lt; 0.001) and increase in I QF ({$\Delta$}0.017 \textpm{} 0.014 kg m 2 , p \&lt; 0.001) occurred in OKC but not in CKC (CoM QF : {$\Delta$}-2.2 \textpm{} 2.0 cm, I QF : {$\Delta$}-0.022 \textpm{} 0.020 kg m 2 , p \&gt; 0.05). Regional hemodynamics assessed by NIRS during a single training session displayed similar exercise and regional differences and predicted 39.6\% of observed changes in CoM QF . Conclusions: Exercise selection influences muscle shape sufficiently to affect CoM QF and I QF , and these changes may be predicted in part from NIRS measurements during a single workout. Given I QF is inversely related to running economy and since CKC exercise provides a more proximal pattern of hypertrophy than OKC, it may be more preferential for running. The results from the present study also highlight the potential of NIRS as a tool for predicting patterns of hypertrophy between different exercises and exercise conditions.}

This survey examines (a) background information, (b) physical testing, (c) flexibility development, (d) speed development, (e) plyometrics, (f) strength/power development, (g) unique aspects, and (h) comments. Results indicate, in part, that coaches assess an average of 3.6 parameters of fitness, with body composition testing being the most commonly assessed parameter. All coaches use a variety of flexibility development strategies. All coaches use speed development strategies, with form running drills being the most common. Twenty of 21 (95.2\%) coaches employ plyometric exercises with their athletes. Eighteen of 21 (85.7\%) of MLB S\&C coaches follow a periodization model (PM). Five of 21 coaches (23.8\%) indicated that their athletes use Olympic-style lifts. The squat and its variations and the lunge and its variations were most frequently identified as the first and second most important exercises used to train the athletes. This survey provides detailed information about strength and conditioning practices at the most competitive level of baseball and serves as a review, as well as a source of applied information and new ideas.},

The purpose of which is to measure the physiological response of KBS against an already established modality. Subsequent data provide insight of the efficacy of kettlebells swings in strengthening the lumbar muscles and lower back pain treatment. Eight physically active males participated in a repeated measures design where participants completed all conditions. There were statistically significant reductions in maximal torque, reported as strength index (SI), after both KBS and ILEX exercise. A statistically significant difference was found for reductions in maximal torque between CON and both KBS (p = 0.005) and ILEX (p = 0.001) and between KBS and ILEX (p = 0.039). Mean reduction and effect sizes were -1824 \textpm{} 1127.12 (SI) and -1.62 for KBS and -4775.6 \textpm{} 1593.41 (SI) and -3.00 for ILEX. In addition, a statistically significant difference was found between KBS and ILEX for rate of perceived exertion (p = 0.012). Data suggest that both KBS and ILEX were able to fatigue the lumbar extensors. Isolated lumbar extension was able to generate a greater level of fatigue. However, contrary to previous research, the KBS was able to elicit a physiological response, despite the lack of pelvic restraint supporting the potential to strengthen the lumbar extensors.},

  abstract = {"It is the morning of June 22, 1936. The professor of inductive logic at the University of Vienna, Moritz Schlick, is making his accustomed way up the wide stone stairs that lead into the University. It is 9:15 and a former student of Schlick's, Johann Nelb\`eock, is loitering on the staircase, waiting for him. As Schlick approaches, Johann Nelb\`eock lifts a pistol and fires four shots. A witness hears him shout, "Now you damned bastard, there you have it". Schlick dies immediately. His death spells the ending of the remarkable philosophical grouping of which he had been founder and moving force, the Vienna Circle. This extraordinary group of mathematicians, logicians, physicists, philosophers and social scientists has been holding regular meetings under Schlick's leadership since 1922. But in 1936 the political landscape in Austria is darkening, and exile for members of the Circle already beckons. It is not to be a happy experience for many of them-uprooted from Viennese culture, separated from old friends and intellectual soul-mates. The governing principle for which the Circle is best known, logical positivism, famously maintained that only two types of propositions were meaningful: those that could be verified through experience (e.g. water boils at 100 degrees centigrade) and those that were analytically true - true by virtue of the terms they employed (e.g. all bachelors are unmarried men). All other propositions were, literally, meaningless. These included propositions about God and certain propositions about aesthetics and morality (such as 'murder is wrong'). A list of names linked to the Circle reads like a Who's Who of 20th century philosophy, mathematics and science. In addition to Schlick, it includes Rudolf Carnap, Otto Neurath, Phillip Frank, Hans Hahn, Olga Hahn-Neurath, Karl Menger, Friedrich Waismann, Herbert Feigl, Kurt G\`eodel, Carl Hempel, W.V.O. Quine, A J Ayer, and also, indirectly but influentially, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Karl Popper. For a period, Logical Positivism with its attempt to analyze 'truth', 'knowledge', and the limits of meaning, was the most fashionable movement in the world. Though its central tenets were ultimately abandoned, the Circle - especially through the exile of its key figures in the UK and US - had an enormous influence on 20th century philosophy and beyond. This book is about the origins, the short, influential life and the untimely death of the Vienna Circle, and the afterlife of its adherents"--},

Data from this test was used to obtain data sets of three test lengths (10, 20, and 30 items) and nine different sample sizes (150, 250, 350, 500, 750, 1,000, 2,000, 3,000 and 5,000 examinees). These data sets were then used to create various research conditions in which test length, sample size, and IRT model variables were manipulated to investigate item parameter estimation accuracy under different conditions. The results suggest that rather than sample size or test length, the combination of these two variables is important and samples of 150, 250, 350, 500, and 750 examinees can be used to estimate item parameters accurately in three unidimensional dichotomous IRT models, depending on test length and model employed.},

  abstract = {The accurate measurement of the cognitive load a learner encounters in a given task is critical to the understanding and application of Cognitive Load Theory (CLT). However, as a covert psychological construct, cognitive load represents a challenging measurement issue. To date, this challenge has been met mostly by subjective self-reports of cognitive load experienced in a learning situation. In this paper, we find that a valid and reliable index of cognitive load can be obtained through item response modeling of student performance. Specifically, estimates derived from item response modeling of relative difficulty (i.e., the difference between item difficulty and person ability locations) can function as a linear measure that combines the key components of cognitive load (i.e., mental load, mental effort, and performance). This index of cognitive load (relative difficulty) was tested for criterion (concurrent) validity in Year 2 learners (N = 91) performance on standardized educational numeracy and literacy assessments. Learners' working memory (WM) capacity significantly predicted our proposed cognitive load (relative difficulty) index across both numeracy and literacy domains. That is, higher levels of WM were related to lower levels of cognitive load (relative difficulty), in line with fundamental predictions of CLT. These results illustrate the validity, utility and potential of this objective item response modeling approach to capturing individual differences in cognitive load across discrete learning tasks.},

We further examined between-day variability of high intensity functional strength and endurance performance testing with and without VE. Nineteen experienced athletes (seven females and 12 males, age: 23.7 \textpm{} 4.3 years) performed a standardized one repetition maximum (1 RM) squat test and a 12-min high-intensity functional training (HIFT) workout [as many repetitions as possible (AMRAP)] on four different days over a 2-week period. Athletes randomly performed each test twice, either with VE or without (CON), with a minimum of 72 h rest between tests. Very good to excellent relative between-day reliability with slightly better values for strength testing (ICC: 0.99; CV: 3.5-4.1\%) compared to endurance testing (ICC 0.87-0.95; CV: 3.9-7.3\%) were observed. Interestingly, VE led to higher reliability during endurance testing. Mean squat strength depicted higher strength values with VE (107 \textpm{} 33 kg) compared to CON (105 \textpm{} 33 kg; p = 0.009, Cohen's d: 0.06). AMRAP in the endurance test showed negligible differences between VE (182 \textpm{} 33 AMRAP) and CON (181 \textpm{} 35 AMRAP; p = 0.71, Cohen's d: 0.03). In conclusion, the effects of VE do not notably exceed day-to-day variability during high intensity functional strength (CV: 3.5-4.1\%) and endurance (CV: 3.9-7.3\%) testing. However, high intensity functional strength and endurance testing with VE seems to be slightly more reliable, particularly during endurance testing.},

Success in bodybuilding requires that competitors achieve their peak physique during the day of competition. To this end, competitors have been reported to employ various peaking interventions during the final days leading to competition. Commonly reported peaking strategies include altering exercise and nutritional regimens, including manipulation of macronutrient, water, and electrolyte intake, as well as consumption of various dietary supplements. The primary goals for these interventions are to maximize muscle glycogen content, minimize subcutaneous water, and reduce the risk abdominal bloating to bring about a more aesthetically pleasing physique. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of evidence to support the commonly reported practices employed by bodybuilders during peak week. Hence, the purpose of this article is to critically review the current literature as to the scientific support for pre-contest peaking protocols most commonly employed by bodybuilders and provide evidence-based recommendations as safe and effective strategies on the topic.},

  abstract = {Currently, little is known about the extent of interindividual variability in response to beta-alanine (BA) supplementation, nor what proportion of said variability can be attributed to external factors or to the intervention itself (intervention response). To investigate this, individual participant data on the effect of BA supplementation on a high-intensity cycling capacity test (CCT110\%) were meta-analyzed. Changes in time to exhaustion (TTE) and muscle carnosine were the primary and secondary outcomes. Multilevel distributional Bayesian models were used to estimate the mean and SD of BA and placebo group change scores. The relative sizes of group SDs were used to infer whether observed variation in change scores were due to intervention or non-intervention-related effects. Six eligible studies were identified, and individual data were obtained from four of these. Analyses showed a group effect of BA supplementation on TTE (7.7, 95\% credible interval [CrI] [1.3, 14.3]~s) and muscle carnosine (18.1, 95\% CrI [14.5, 21.9]~mmol/kg DM). A large intervention response variation was identified for muscle carnosine ({$\sigma$}IR = 5.8, 95\% CrI [4.2, 7.4]~mmol/kg DM) while equivalent change score SDs were shown for TTE in both the placebo (16.1, 95\% CrI [13.0, 21.3]~s) and BA (15.9, 95\% CrI [13.0, 20.0]~s) conditions, with the probability that SD was greater in placebo being 0.64. In conclusion, the similarity in observed change score SDs between groups for TTE indicates the source of variation is common to both groups, and therefore unrelated to the supplement itself, likely originating instead from external factors such as nutritional intake, sleep patterns, or training status.},

  abstract = {The prescription of resistance exercise often involves administering a set number of repetitions to be completed at a given relative load. While this accounts for individual differences in strength, it neglects to account for differences in local muscle endurance and may result in varied responses across individuals. One way of potentially creating a more homogenous stimulus across individuals involves performing resistance exercise to volitional failure, but this has not been tested and was the purpose of the present study. Individuals completed 2 testing sessions to compare repetitions, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), muscle swelling and fatigue responses to arbitrary repetition (SET) vs. failure (FAIL) protocols using either 60\% or 30\% one-repetition maximum. Statistical analyses assessed differences in the variability between protocols. Forty-six individuals (25 females and 21 males) completed the study. There was more variability in the number of repetitions completed during FAIL when compared to SET protocols. Performing the 60\% 1RM condition to failure appeared to reduce the variability in muscle swelling (average variance: 60\%-SET\,=\,.034, 60\%-FAIL\,=\,.023) and RPE (average variance: 60\%-SET\,=\,4.0, 60\%-FAIL\,=\,2.5), but did not alter the variability in muscle fatigue. No differences in variability were present between the SET-30\% and FAIL-30\% protocols for any of the dependent variables. Performing resistance exercise to failure may result in a more homogenous stimulus across individuals, particularly when using moderate to high exercise loads. The prescription of resistance exercise should account for individual differences in local muscle endurance to ensure a similarly effective stimulus across individuals.Highlights There is a large variance in the number of repetitions individuals can complete even when exercising with the same relative load.Ratings of perceived exertion and muscle swelling responses become more homogenous when exercising to volitional failure as compared to using performing a set number of repetitions, particularly when moderate to higher loads are used.The prescription of exercise should take into consideration the individual's local muscle endurance as opposed to choosing an arbitrary number of repetitions to be completed at a given relative load.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The present study compared the fatigue and perceptual responses to volume-load matched heavier- and lighter-~load resistance exercise to momentary failure in both a local/exercised, and non-local/non-exercised limb. Methods: Eleven resistance-trained men undertook unilateral maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) testing for knee extension prior to and immediately, 24 hr- and 48 hr- post heavier (80\% MVC) and lighter~ (40\% MVC) load dynamic unilateral knee extension exercise. Only the dominant leg of each participant was exercised to momentary failure using heavier and lighter~loads, and perceptions of discomfort were measured immediately upon exercise cessation. Results: Point estimates and confidence intervals suggested that immediately post-exercise there was greater fatigue in both the exercised and non-exercised legs for the lighter-~load condition. At 24 hr the exercised leg under the heavier-load condition had recovered to pre-exercise strength; however, the exercised leg under lighter-~load condition had still not fully recovered by 48 hr. For the non-exercised leg, only the lighter-load condition induced fatigue; however, recovery had occurred by 48 hr. Median discomfort ratings were statistically significantly different (Z~=~-2.232, p =~.026) between lighter and heavier~loads (10 [IQR~=~0] and 8 [IQR~=~3], respectively). Conclusions: This study suggests that lighter-load resistance exercise induces greater fatigue in both the exercised- and non-exercised limbs, compared to heavier-load resistance exercise. These findings may have implications for exercise frequency as it may be possible to engage in heavier-load resistance exercise more frequently than a volume-load matched protocol using lighter loads.Abbreviations CI: Confidence intervals: ES: Effect size: MVC: Maximum voluntary contraction; Nm:Newton meters; RM: Repetition maximum; SD: Standard deviation; SI: Strength index.},

  abstract = {During the last nearly 50 years, the blood lactate curve and lactate thresholds (LTs) have become important in the diagnosis of endurance performance. An intense and ongoing debate emerged, which was mainly based on terminology and/or the physiological background of LT concepts. The present review aims at evaluating LTs with regard to their validity in assessing endurance capacity. Additionally, LT concepts shall be integrated within the 'aerobic-anaerobic transition' - a framework which has often been used for performance diagnosis and intensity prescriptions in endurance sports. Usually, graded incremental exercise tests, eliciting an exponential rise in blood lactate concentrations (bLa), are used to arrive at lactate curves. A shift of such lactate curves indicates changes in endurance capacity. This very global approach, however, is hindered by several factors that may influence overall lactate levels. In addition, the exclusive use of the entire curve leads to some uncertainty as to the magnitude of endurance gains, which cannot be precisely estimated. This deficiency might be eliminated by the use of LTs. The aerobic-anaerobic transition may serve as a basis for individually assessing endurance performance as well as for prescribing intensities in endurance training. Additionally, several LT approaches may be integrated in this framework. This model consists of two typical breakpoints that are passed during incremental exercise: the intensity at which bLa begin to rise above baseline levels and the highest intensity at which lactate production and elimination are in equilibrium (maximal lactate steady state [MLSS]). Within this review, LTs are considered valid performance indicators when there are strong linear correlations with (simulated) endurance performance. In addition, a close relationship between LT and MLSS indicates validity regarding the prescription of training intensities. A total of 25 different LT concepts were located. All concepts were divided into three categories. Several authors use fixed bLa during incremental exercise to assess endurance performance (category 1). Other LT concepts aim at detecting the first rise in bLa above baseline levels (category 2). The third category consists of threshold concepts that aim at detecting either the MLSS or a rapid/distinct change in the inclination of the blood lactate curve (category 3). Thirty-two studies evaluated the relationship of LTs with performance in (partly simulated) endurance events. The overwhelming majority of those studies reported strong linear correlations, particularly for running events, suggesting a high percentage of common variance between LT and endurance performance. In addition, there is evidence that some LTs can estimate the MLSS. However, from a practical and statistical point of view it would be of interest to know the variability of individual differences between the respective threshold and the MLSS, which is rarely reported. Although there has been frequent and controversial debate on the LT phenomenon during the last three decades, many scientific studies have dealt with LT concepts, their value in assessing endurance performance or in prescribing exercise intensities in endurance training. The presented framework may help to clarify some aspects of the controversy and may give a rationale for performance diagnosis and training prescription in future research as well as in sports practice.},

  abstract = {Lactate (La-) has long been at the center of controversy in research, clinical, and athletic settings. Since its discovery in 1780, La- has often been erroneously viewed as simply a hypoxic waste product with multiple deleterious effects. Not until the 1980s, with the introduction of the cell-to-cell lactate shuttle did a paradigm shift in our understanding of the role of La- in metabolism begin. The evidence for La- as a major player in the coordination of whole-body metabolism has since grown rapidly. La- is a readily combusted fuel that is shuttled throughout the body, and it is a potent signal for angiogenesis irrespective of oxygen tension. Despite this, many fundamental discoveries about La- are still working their way into mainstream research, clinical care, and practice. The purpose of this review is to synthesize current understanding of La- metabolism via an appraisal of its robust experimental history, particularly in exercise physiology. That La- production increases during dysoxia is beyond debate, but this condition is the exception rather than the rule. Fluctuations in blood [La-] in health and disease are not typically due to low oxygen tension, a principle first demonstrated with exercise and now understood to varying degrees across disciplines. From its role in coordinating whole-body metabolism as a fuel to its role as a signaling molecule in tumors, the study of La- metabolism continues to expand and holds potential for multiple clinical applications. This review highlights La-'s central role in metabolism and amplifies our understanding of past research.},

The increased RPE with a motor task, such as the Finger-Tapping Test (FTT), can easily be measured in the clinical setting.Objectives:To correlate the FTT, RPE and the Brief Fatigue Inventory (BFI) rated fatigue severity in patients with cancer.Methods:Subjective fatigue was assessed in adult patients with cancer by the BFI. Participants performed a modified FTT with the index finger of the dominant hand: 15 seconds ? 2, 30 seconds ? 2, and 60 seconds ? 2 with 1 minute of rest between each time trial. Rating of perceived effort at the end of task was measured by the Borg 10 scale.Exclusions:Brain metastasis, history of brain radiation, Parkinson disease, Huntington Chorea, multiple sclerosis, delirium, and depression. Pearson correlation coefficients were used to describe the relationships between BFI, FTT, and Borg 10 scale.Results:Thirty patients participated. Mean age was 56.2. Sixteen were females (53.3\%). The mean BFI mean was 4.1, median 4.4. Tapping rate did not correlate with fatigue severity. The RPE correlated with the mean BFI: r s 0.438, P = .0155. These correlations persisted after adjustment for age.Conclusion:An increased RPE in the absence of task failure suggests that the origin of CRF is central. The performance of an FTT with RPE helps to improve our understanding of fatigue in the clinical setting.},

Effects of different types of resistance training and detraining on functional capacity, muscle strength, and power in older women: A randomized controlled study. J Strength Cond Res 36(4): 984-990, 2022-Resistance training (RT) increases muscle strength, power, and functional capacity (FC) of older women. However, these benefits can be lost partially or totally with detraining. This study aimed to compare the effect of 20 weeks of different types of RT and 4 weeks of detraining on muscle strength, power, and FC in older women. Ninety-five older women were randomly divided into 4 experimental groups (strength endurance, power, absolute strength, and relative strength training) and 1 control group (CG). We assessed muscle strength (10RM test) and muscle power of the lower (countermovement jump) and upper limbs (medicine ball pitch). Functional capacity was assessed by the Senior Fitness Test, which comprises the following tests: 30-second arm curl, 30-second chair stand, back scratch, chair sit and reach, 8-foot up and go, and 6-minute walk. The experiment lasted 24 weeks (familiarization: 2 weeks; neural adaptation: 6 weeks; specific training: 12 weeks; and detraining: 4 weeks). Muscle strength, lower and upper limb power (all p {$<$} 0.05), 30-second arm curl, 30-second chair stand, 8-foot up and go, 6-minute walk (all p {$<$} 0.001), and lower limb flexibility (p = 0.002) improved in all experimental groups after training and CG showed no differences in any of these variables. After detraining, muscle strength, lower and upper limb power (p {$<$} 0.05 for all), and FC decreased in comparison to the end of RT (30-second arm curl, 30-second chair stand, 8-foot up and go, 6-minute walk, and lower limb flexibility, p {$<$} 0.05 for all). Although the FC of the subjects has been reduced after 4 weeks of detraining, it was maintained at higher levels in comparison to baseline. These results suggested that older women can be submitted to different types of RT to achieve improvements in general fitness.},

  abstract = {The paper addresses three neglected questions from IRT. In section 1, the properties of the ``measurement'' of ability or trait parameters and item difficulty parameters in the Rasch model are discussed. It is shown that the solution to this problem is rather complex and depends both on general assumptions about properties of the item response functions and on assumptions about the available item universe. Section 2 deals with the measurement of individual change or ``modifiability'' based on a Rasch test. A conditional likelihood approach is presented that yields (a) an ML estimator of modifiability for given item parameters, (b) allows one to test hypotheses about change by means of a Clopper-Pearson confidence interval for the modifiability parameter, or (c) to estimate modifiability jointly with the item parameters. Uniqueness results for all three methods are also presented. In section 3, the Mantel-Haenszel method for detecting DIF is discussed under a novel perspective: What is the most general framework within which the Mantel-Haenszel method correctly detects DIF of a studied item? The answer is that this is a 2PL model where, however, all discrimination parameters are known and the studied item has the same discrimination in both populations. Since these requirements would hardly be satisfied in practical applications, the case of constant discrimination parameters, that is, the Rasch model, is the only realistic framework. A simple Pearsonx2 test for DIF of one studied item is proposed as an alternative to the Mantel-Haenszel test; moreover, this test is generalized to the case of two items simultaneously studied for DIF.},

RESULTS: Analyses revealed a significant reduction in MVIT (P\,{$<$}\,0.05) with a significant between-condition effect, and significant post-hoc pairwise comparisons between LL and both HL (P\,=\,0.044) and FR (P\,=\,0.013). There were no significant between-condition effects for effort or discomfort (P\,{$>$}\,0.05).

CrossFit is a fitness movement that has seen an explosive growth in popularity worldwide; however, little research has investigated the motivational factors within this "niche" resistance exercise environment. The aim of this study was to explore the motivational factors of CrossFit participants in comparison to other resistance exercise participants. METHODS: Using an independent-group design, quantitative data was collected using exercise motivations inventory-2 (EMI-2) questionnaire, for a total of 314 male and female participants (CrossFit: N.=68, group resistance exercise: N.=55, alone: N.=125, personal trainer: N.=66). RESULTS: The present study suggest that CrossFit participants were more likely to report higher levels of intrinsic motives, such as enjoyment, challenge and affiliation, whereas personal training clients reported higher values for health related motives such as positive health, ill-health avoidance and weight management. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that the motivations for engaging in CrossFit may be similar to those seen in sport participation, and therefore may have an influence on facilitating long-term adherence in comparison with other resistance exercise modalities. This article also discusses health related motives as being extrinsic in nature but reflecting intrinsic characteristics, potentially also facilitating long term adherence. The present research helps develop further understanding of motivational variables within differing resistance exercise modalities.},

Nine recreationally active males (age, 21.4 \textpm{} 1.2 years; height, 1.79 \textpm{} 0.07 m; weight, 78.4 \textpm{} 7.1 kg) performed unilateral resistance training at 80\% of maximal torque at 2\texttimes/week for 6 weeks. Using their nondominant leg, participants performed 5 sets of 5 repetitions (NMF). Using their dominant leg, participants performed 25 repetitions in as few sets as possible (MMF). All repetitions were performed at a pace of 2 s concentric, 1 s isometric pause, and 2 s eccentric with a 2-min rest interval between sets. Analyses identified significant pre- to post-intervention strength increases for both MMF and NMF, with effect sizes (ESs) of 2.01 and 1.65, respectively, with no significant differences between conditions (p {$>$} 0.05). Peak and mean ratings of perceived exertion (RPEs) were significantly higher for MMF compared with NMF conditions (p {$<$} 0.0001), and a tendency for significantly higher RPE values reported for later sets for the NMF condition. Total training time per session was significantly longer for NMF compared with MMF (p {$<$} 0.001). The present study suggests that in untrained participants, resistance training NMF produces equivocally the same strength increases as training to MMF when volume-matched. However, resistance training to MMF appears to be a more time-efficient protocol and may produce greater strength gains as indicated by a larger ES.},

Thirty-nine trained participants (male = 9, female = 30) completed 12 weeks of resistance training in 1 of 3 groups: a group that performed PreEx training (n = 14), a group that performed the same exercise order with a rest interval between exercises (n = 17), and a control group (n = 8) that performed the same exercises in a different order (compound exercises prior to isolation). No significant between-group effects were found for strength in chest press, leg press, or pull-down exercises, or for body composition changes. Magnitude of change was examined for outcomes also using effect size (ES). ESs for strength changes were considered large for each group for every exercise (ranging 1.15 to 1.62). In conclusion, PreEx training offers no greater benefit to performing the same exercises with rest between them compared with exercises performed in an order that prioritises compound movements.},

All resistance types (e.g. free-weights, resistance machines, bodyweight, etc.) show potential for increases in strength, with no significant difference between them, although resistance machines appear to pose a lower risk of injury. There is a lack of evidence to suggest that balance from free weights or use of unstable surfaces shows any transfer-ence to sporting improvement, and explosive movements are also not recommended as they present a high injury risk and no greater benefit than slow, controlled weight training.

METHODS: Strength responses to heavier load (HL; 80\% maximum voluntary isometric torque; MVIT) and lighter load (LL; 50\% MVIT) resistance training were examined in addition to acute perceptions of effort and discomfort. Seven men (20.6\,\textpm\,0.5 years, 178.9\,\textpm\,3.2\,cm, 77.1\,\textpm\,2.7\,kg) performed unilateral resistance training of the knee extensors to momentary failure using HL and LL. RESULTS: Analyses revealed significant pre- to post-intervention increases in strength for both HL and LL, with no significant between-group differences (P\,{$>$}\,0.05). Mean repetitions per set, total training time, and discomfort were all significantly higher for LL compared with HL (P\,{$<$}\,0.05). CONCLUSION: This study indicates that resistance training with HL and LL produces similar strength adaptations, but discomfort should be considered before selecting a training load.

  abstract = {Objectives: Muscles dominant in type I muscle fibres, such as the lumbar extensors, are often trained using lighter loads and higher repetition ranges. However, literature suggests that similar strength adaptations can be attained by the use of both heavier- (HL) and lighter-load (LL) resistance training across a number of appendicular muscle groups. Furthermore, LL resistance exercise to momentary failure might result in greater discomfort. Design: The aims of the present study were to compare strength adaptations, as well as perceptual responses of effort (RPE-E) and discomfort (RPE-D), to isolated lumbar extension (ILEX) exercise using HL (80\% of maximum voluntary contraction; MVC) and LL (50\% MVC) in healthy males and females. Methods: Twenty-six participants (n = 14 males, n = 12 females) were divided in to sex counter-balanced HL (23 \textpm{} 5 years; 172.3 \textpm{} 9.8 cm; 71.0 \textpm{} 13.1 kg) and LL (22 \textpm{} 2 years; 175.3 \textpm{} 6.3 cm; 72.8 \textpm{} 9.5 kg) resistance training groups. All participants performed a single set of dynamic ILEX exercise 1 day/week for 6 weeks using either 80\% (HL) or 50\% (LL) of their MVC to momentary failure. Results: Analyses revealed significant pre- to post-intervention increases in isometric strength for both HL and LL, with no significant between-group differences (p~{$>~$}0.05). Changes in strength index (area under torque curves) were 2,891 Nm degrees 95\% CIs [1,612-4,169] and 2,865 Nm degrees 95\% CIs [1,587-4,144] for HL and LL respectively. Changes in MVC were 51.7 Nm 95\% CIs [24.4-79.1] and 46.0 Nm 95\% CIs [18.6-73.3] for HL and LL respectively. Mean repetitions per set, total training time and discomfort were all significantly higher for LL compared to HL (26 \textpm{} 8 vs. 8 \textpm{} 3 repetitions, 158.5 \textpm{} 47 vs. 50.5 \textpm{} 15 s, and 7.8 \textpm{} 1.8 vs. 4.8 \textpm{} 2.5, respectively; all p~{$<~$}0.005). Conclusions: The present study supports that that low-volume, low-frequency ILEX resistance exercise can produce similar strength increases in the lumbar extensors using either HL or LL. As such personal trainers, trainees and strength coaches can consider other factors which might impact acute performance (e.g. effort and discomfort during the exercise). This data might prove beneficial in helping asymptomatic persons reduce the risk of low-back pain, and further research, might consider the use of HL exercise for chronic low-back pain symptomatic persons.},

Despite this, position stands and recommendations are made based on, we propose, limited evidence to lift heavier weights. Here we discuss the state of evidence on the impact of load and how it, as a single variable, stimulates adaptations to take place and whether evidence for recommending heavier loads is available, well-defined, currently correctly interpreted or has been overlooked. Areas of discussion include electromyography amplitude, in vivo and in vitro methods of measuring hypertrophy, and motor schema and skill acquisition. The present piece clarifies to trainers and trainees the impact of these variables by discussing interpretation of synchronous and sequential motor unit recruitment and revisiting the size principle, poor agreement between whole-muscle cross-sectional area (CSA) and biopsy-determined changes in myofibril CSA, and neural adaptations around task specificity. Our opinion is that the practical implications of being able to self-select external load include reducing the need for specific facility memberships, motivating older persons or those who might be less confident using heavy loads, and allowing people to undertake home- or field-based resistance training intervention strategies that might ultimately improve exercise adherence.},

The time taken to complete each trial, heart rate, rating of perceived exertion and speed were all assessed. Intra-subject absolute standard error of measurement and the coefficient of variance were calculated for time-trial variables in addition to the intra-class correlation coefficient for time taken to complete the time-trial. For the primary measure time, results showed a coefficient of variation score across all participants of 1.5 \textpm{} 0.59\% with an intra-class correlation coefficient score of 0.990. Heart rate, rating of perceived exertion and speed data showed a variance range between 0.8 and 3.05\%. It was concluded that when compared with related research, there was observed low intra-subject variability in trained runners over a 5 km distance. This supports the use of this protocol for 5 km time-trial performance for assessment of nutritional strategies, ergogenic aids or training interventions on endurance running performance.},

A short review of studies reporting considerable health benefits resulting from low volume resistance training participation is presented, specifically considering the training time, frequency, intensity of effort, and exercises performed.

Our hope is that discussion of these specific recommendations, and provision of an example minimal dose workout, will promote resistance training participation by persons who might otherwise have not engaged.

A short review of studies reporting considerable health benefits resulting from low volume resistance training participation is presented, specifically considering the training time, frequency, intensity of effort, and exercises performed. Research supports the considerable physiological and psychological health benefits from resistance training and suggests that these can be obtained using a minimal dose approach (e.g. {$\leq$}60min, 2d-wk-1), using uncomplicated equipment/methods (e.g. weight stack machines). Our hope is that discussion of these specific recommendations, and provision of an example minimal dose workout, will promote resistance training participation by persons who might otherwise have not engaged. We also encourage medical professionals to use this information to prescribe resistance exercise like a drug whilst having an awareness of the health benefits and uncomplicated methods.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Sport plays a major role in the physical activity, wellbeing and socialisation of children and adults. However, a growing prevalence of concussions in sports persists, furthermore, that subconcussive forces are responsible for neurodegenerative conditions. Current approaches towards concussion prevention are dependent upon coaching strategies and enforcement by referees, or only attempt to reduce further injury, not prevent initial injury occurring. A growing body of research has shown that strengthening the muscles of the neck might serve to reduce head acceleration, change in velocity and dissipate kinetic energy from concussive and subconcussive forces. Design: Following ethical approval and parental consent a single arm, pilot study recruited 13 male and 13 female high school stu dents to undertake 8 weeks of neck strengthening exercises 2 d.wk-1. Method: A low-volume, time-efficient approach considered progressive strength training for neck extension, flexion, and right- and left-lateral flexion exercises for a single set to muscular failure. Results: Strength outcome data was analysed using paired samples t-tests comparing predicted 1-repetition maximum for week 1 and week 8 revealing significant strength improvements for both males and females for all exercises; p {$<$} 0.001. Effect sizes were very large (2.3-4.3) for all exercises for both males and females. Conclusions: Participants showed very large increases in neck strength suggesting previous detrained condition and the potential to significantly improve strength using a simple, low volume, resistance training protocol. Athletic training should prioritise health of participants and longevity of career and as such the authors present a neck strengthening protocol with a view to reducing injury risks.},

This has been represented as variation in load and subsequently repetitions as well as volume, with a view to maximize strength and hypertrophy adaptations. A number of recent review articles have attempted to draw overarching conclusions from the present body of literature in an effort to provide definitive guidelines. However, there are numerous variables within resistance training that are often overlooked, and in the context of periodization, might significantly impact adaptation. Design \& Methods: Narrative Review Results: The present piece confers need for clarity in terminology of effort rather than intensity, as well as discussing how variety of load might impact volume-load, discomfort, muscle damage and recovery. Furthermore, this article discusses often over looked variables such as variety in exercise selection, detraining periods, and supervision, which are all evidenced to impact strength and hypertrophy adaptations. Conclusions: Our opinion is that without inclusion of these variables any guidelines surrounding periodization for strength or hypertrophy are limited in application. We conclude by highlighting areas for future research, as well as practical recommendations within this field.},

Thus purpose of this commentary is to highlight the importance of the moral injunction Primum non nocere, and of weighing risks to rewards of training methods, for those providing resistance training recommendations and practitioners of it as a training approach. Design \& Methods: Narrative review Results: It appears that many popular resistance training methods that make use of either explosive movements or unstable platforms with heavy external loading may present an increased risk of injury. In addition they may not offer any greater improvements to measures of health and fitness above safer alternatives that utilise more controlled repetition durations and avoid use of unstable platforms. Indeed, as resistance type and load may not be as important for determining strength or hypertrophic adaptations as previously thought, nor does there appear to be much supporting evidence for the transfer of balance skills developed using unstable platforms to other movement skills, the necessity of such unsafe practices appears further questionable. Conclusions: It is recommended that persons wishing to engage in resistance training for the purposes of health and fitness whilst reducing risk of injury should utilise a controlled repetition duration that maintains muscular tension and avoid use of unstable platforms. Indeed, practices involving use of lower external loads, or even the absence of external loads such as bodyweight training or isometric co-contraction, may also be effective and may pose an even lower risk of injury.},

In presenting a strong body of recent research which demonstrably challenges these perceptions we suggest alternate hypotheses towards physiological adaptation which is hinged more upon the effort than the exercise modality. Practical implications of this interpretation of exercise adaptation might effect change in exercise adherence since existing barriers to exercise of time, costs, specialized equipment, etc. become nullified. In presenting the evidence herein we suggest that lay persons wishing to attain the health and fitness (including strength and muscle hypertrophy) benefits of exercise can choose from a wide range of potential exercise modalities so long as the effort is high. Future research should consider this hypothesis by directly comparing RE and AE for acute responses and chronic adaptations.},

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed for performance/ functional outcomes and/or body composition measurements. Results: 12 studies were included in the review; 301 and 276 participants were in supervised and unsupervised groups, respectively. The main model for all performance/function effects revealed a small, standardised point estimate favouring SUP (0.28 [95\%CI = 0.02 to 0.55]). For sub-grouped outcome types, there was very poor precision of robust estimates for speed, power, function, and endurance. However, for strength there was a moderate effect favouring SUP (0.40 [95\%CI = 0.06 to 0.74]). The main model for all body composition effects revealed a trivial standardised point estimate favouring SUP (0.07 [95\%CI = -0.01 to 0.15]). Conclusions: Supervised resistance training, compared to unsupervised training, might produce a small effect on increases in performance/function, most likely in strength, but has little impact on body composition outcomes.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The accepted wisdom within resistance training is that differing loads and corresponding repetition maximum (RM) ranges are optimal for inducing specific adaptations. For example, prominent organizations and their respective publications have typically prescribed heavy loads for maximal strength increases ( {$\geq$} 85\% 1RM/ {$\leq$} 6RM), more moderate loads for hypertrophy (67-85\% 1RM/6-12RM) and lighter loads for local muscular endurance (LME; {$\leq$} 67\% 1RM/ {$\geq$} 12RM). Since we believe these recommendations originate from a misunderstanding and misinterpretation of DeLorme's strength-endurance continuum, the aim of this narrative review is to discuss the preponderance of research surrounding training load and strength and LME adaptations. Design \& Methods: Narrative Review Results: The current body of literature fails to support recommendations for the use of specific loads for specific strength, hypertrophy or LME adaptations. Furthermore, that the strength-endurance continuum originally presented by DeLorme was never intended to compare the use of heavier- and lighter-load resistance training, but rather to consider the adaptations to strength training and aerobically based endurance exercise. Finally, a lack of clarity considering absolute- and relative- LME has confounded understanding of this adaptation. Conclusions: The body of research supports that absolute LME appears to adapt as a result of maximal strength increases. However, relative LME shows minimal response to strength training with either heavier- or lighter-loads. We present the limitations of the current body of research and promote specifically detailed recent research as well as the importance of generality of strength and LME in both sporting and real-world settings.},

  abstract = {Chronological aging is associated with a decrease in skeletal muscle mass and bone mineral density, an increase in fat mass, frequency of falls and fractures, and the likelihood of obesity, diabetes, and coronary heart disease. Resistance exercise has been shown to counter all of these effects of aging and, in turn, reduce the risk of all-cause mortality. However, variables such as volume and frequency have become contentious issues, with recent publications suggesting that similar physiological adaptations are possible with both high- and low-volume approaches. The aim of this research was to consider strength increases as a result of brief, infrequent resistance exercise. The present study offers data from 33 (14 male and 19 female) older adults (M = 55 years) who underwent brief ({$<$}15 minutes per exercise session), infrequent (2\texttimes/week), resistance exercise to a high intensity of effort (6-repetition maximum) at a controlled repetition duration (10 seconds concentric\,:\,10 seconds eccentric) on 5 resistance machines (chest press, leg press, pull-down, seated row, and overhead press). Data is presented for training interventions of 12 weeks (male) and 19 weeks (female). Significant strength increases were identified for all exercises. With the detailed health benefits obtainable, the present study suggests that resistance exercise can be efficacious in much smaller volumes than previously considered.},

  abstract = {Background: Resistance training has well-documented health benefits; however, participation and adherence remain overwhelmingly low. Supervision has been evidenced to improve adherence, and produce favourable adaptations compared to unsupervised resistance training. A recent exploratory systematic review and meta-analysis on supervision during resistance training noted a lack of clarity as to the purpose/intent of the supervisor within the body of literature. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey study was conducted in English and distributed primarily across social media platforms and through the authors' personal and professional networks. The aim of the survey was to compare the perceptions of supervision between trainers and trainees. Secondary outcomes included exploratory analyses of the impact of training experience, sex of participant, and comparison based on supervision type. Results: 468 participants completed all elements of the survey (68\% male, 32\% female). Of which 236 were personal trainers/strength coaches, and 232 were trainees. In brief, descriptive data from the survey suggest that trainers perceived supervision as more important than trainees for the characteristics and variables measured. Females perceived supervision in resistance training as more important than males. Trainees who engage in supervised resistance training reported supervision to be more important compared to those training alone or with a training partner. Technical coaching was reported to be the most important characteristic of supervision. Finally, trainers and trainees engaging in supervised strength training reported lower injury rates compared to those strength training unsupervised or with a training partner. Qualitative data are presented regarding perceptions of how and why supervision should differ based on sex, age, and experience, as well as reporting injury experiences. Conclusion: Our data suggest that the perceived benefits of supervision vary based on population. We posit that the present data have implications for both trainers and trainees, which might serve to strengthen a relationship by aligning roles and realising goals in supervised resistance training. Further, this data might provide insight and prompt future research as to how to engage more people into resistance training.},

The aim of this review is to discuss supervision as a construct within the parameters of strength training, including differentiating characteristics along a spectrum from supervision to facilitation, the use of different mediums (one-to-one, small group and virtual) and the effects of internal feedback (including perceptions and measures of effort), external feedback (including contemporary technological approaches) and attentional focus, and augmented feedback upon performance outcome measures. Finally, this review discusses the possible importance of positive feedback within supervision and the position of personal training and strength coaching as a service industry, as well as providing context around autonomy and input on the part of the trainee. In context, this paper provides guidance for future researchers about presenting clarity and detail of supervision and feedback, while also providing practitioners with information to stimulate awareness in coaching practices.},

Design: Following ethical approval, employing a within-subject design 12 healthy, resistance-trained males performed a 1-repetition maximum bench press (BP) and three isometric tests at differing elbow joint angles (ISO45\r{}, ISO90\r{}, ISO135\r{}) using a Micro-Gym device. Methods: Surface electromyography (sEMG) was used to assess peak amplitude of the pectoralis major (PM), anterior deltoid (AD) and triceps brachii (TB) muscles. Peak force output for each condition was also measured. Results: Significant effects by condition were found with planned comparisons revealing statistically significant differences for peak sEMG amplitude for TB in addition to peak force between BP and ISO45, ISO90, and ISO135 (p {$<$} 0.05). Analyses revealed similar peak sEMG amplitude for PM and AD for BP and isometric conditions (p {$>$} 0.05). Conclusions: The present study suggests that a contralateral limb resisted training method could be an efficacious method of recruiting motor units and thus may catalyse muscle fibre adaptations in strength and hypertrophy. This novel method might have considerable application to coaches or trainers not wishing to transport large and heavy equipment or in microgravity environments.},

  abstract = {Vernacular lexemes appear self-evident, so we unwittingly reify them. But the words and phrases of natural languages comprise a treacherous basis for identifying valid psychological constructs, as I illustrate in emotion research. Like other vernacular lexemes, the emotion labels in natural languages do not have definite, stable, mutually transparent meanings, and any one vernacular word may be used to denote multiple scientifically distinct entities. In addition, the consequential choice of one lexeme to name a scientific construct rather than any of its partial synonyms is often arbitrary. Furthermore, a given vernacular lexeme from any one of the world's 7000 languages rarely maps one-to-one into an exactly corresponding vernacular lexeme in other languages. Words related to anger in different languages illustrate this. Since each language constitutes a distinct taxonomy of things in the world, most or all languages must fail to cut nature at its joints. In short, it is pernicious to use one language's dictionary as the source of psychological constructs. So scientists need to coin new technical names for scientifically derived constructs---names precisely defined in terms of the constellation of features or components that characterize the constructs they denote. The development of the kama muta construct illustrates one way to go about this. Kama muta is the emotion evoked by sudden intensification of communal sharing---universally experienced but not isomorphic with any vernacular lexeme such as heart warming, moving, touching, collective pride, tender, nostalgic, sentimental, Awww---so cute!.

Based on Bandura's self-efficacy theory, this study was designed to investigate (a) the effects of false information feedback on self-efficacy beliefs and subsequent weightlifting performance, and (b) whether self-efficacy or past performance is most related to subsequent weightlifting performance. Experienced weightlifters engaged in six performance sessions, each consisting of a one-repetition-maximum bench press. Male subjects (N = 36) were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups: accurate performance information, false information that they lifted more than their actual lift, or false information that they lifted less than their actual lift. Before each session, subjects indicated the amount of weight they were 100\%, 75\%, and 50\% confident they could lift. Results replicated existing research findings regarding deception and performance; false positive feedback increased future bench press performance. In addition, results indicated that past weightlifting performance accounted for nearly all of the variance in subsequent performance. This finding is discussed in light of the difficulty in extending the predictions of self-efficacy theory to sport settings where athletes have gained experience by undergoing repeated training trials.},

  abstract = {Progress in psychology has been frustrated by challenges concerning replicability, generalizability, strategy selection, inferential reproducibility, and computational reproducibility. Although often discussed separately, these five challenges may share a common cause: insufficient investment of intellectual and nonintellectual resources into the typical psychology study. We suggest that the emerging emphasis on big-team science can help address these challenges by allowing researchers to pool their resources together to increase the amount available for a single study. However, the current incentives, infrastructure, and institutions in academic science have all developed under the assumption that science is conducted by solo principal investigators and their dependent trainees, an assumption that creates barriers to sustainable big-team science. We also anticipate that big-team science carries unique risks, such as the potential for big-team-science organizations to be co-opted by unaccountable leaders, become overly conservative, and make mistakes at a grand scale. Big-team-science organizations must also acquire personnel who are properly compensated and have clear roles. Not doing so raises risks related to mismanagement and a lack of financial sustainability. If researchers can manage its unique barriers and risks, big-team science has the potential to spur great progress in psychology and beyond.},

Purpose:~           Overtraining  is primarily related to sustained high load training, often coupled with other stressors.  Studies in animal models have suggested that unremittingly heavy training (monotonous  training) may increase the likelihood of developing overtraining syndrome. The purpose  of this study was to extend our preliminary observations by relating the incidence  of illnesses and minor injuries to various indices of training.           Methods:~           We  report observations of the relationship of banal illnesses (a frequently cited marker  of overtraining syndrome) to training load and training monotony in experienced athletes (N = 25). Athletes recorded their training using a method that integrates  the exercise session RPE and the duration of the training session. Illnesses were  noted and correlated with indices of training load (rolling 6 wk average), monotony (daily mean/standard deviation), and strain (load * monotony).           Results:~           It  was observed that a high percentage of illnesses could be accounted for when individual  athletes exceeded individually identifiable training thresholds, mostly related to  the strain of training.           Conclusions:~           These results suggest  that simple methods of monitoring the characteristics of training may allow the athlete  to achieve the goals of training while minimizing undesired training outcomes.},

Hamstrings CSA were acquired with US (by an expert operator) at four different sites of femur length (FL) in 85 youth competitive alpine skiers (14.8\,\textpm\,0.5 years), and successively compared to corresponding scans obtained by MRI, analyzed by a trained vs. a novice rater. The agreement between techniques was assessed by Bland--Altman analyses. Statistical analysis was carried out using Pearson's product moment correlation coefficient ( r ). US-derived CSA showed a very good agreement compared to MRI-based ones. The best sites were 40\% FL (0\,=\,mid patellar point) for biceps femoris long head (r\,=\,0.9), 50\% for semitendinosus (r\,=\,0.9), and 30\% for semimembranosus (r\,=\,0.86) and biceps femoris short head (BFsh, r\,=\,0.8). US-based vs. MRI-based hamstrings volume showed an r of 0.96. Poorer r values were observed for the novice compared to the trained rater, with the biggest difference observed for BFsh at 50\% (r\,=\,0.001 vs. r\,=\,0.50, respectively) and semimembranosus at 60\% (r\,=\,0.23 vs. r\,=\,0.42, respectively). Panoramic US provides valid CSA values and volume estimations compared to MRI. To ensure optimal US-vs.-MRI agreement, raters should preferably possess previous experience in imaging-based analyses.},

Conceptual confusions and questionable philosophical assumptions have contributed to the misguided idea that the quantity of psychological phenomena must or can be demonstrated empirically. First, the measurement debate is characterized by misleading examples and ambiguous terminology. Second, the idea of psychological measurement is inherently Cartesian. In summary, psychological measurement is even more problematic than Michell and Trendler have argued.},

Moreover, I show that, contrary to Michell, it is meaningless to ask whether intelligence is quantitative. Michell and Trendler could counter this claim, but only at the cost of contradicting their stance that conceptual questions are not primary to the empirical questions surrounding psychological measurement. Beyond that, I contend that Trendler?s epistemological distinction of extensive versus intensive quantities does not compensate for the conceptual confusions inherent in his and Michell?s examples. Finally, I emphasize that all disputants agree that psychological measurement is a highly questionable idea.},

Each paper uses a different framework or set of frameworks for defining a typology of scales.In the first paper, I begin the analysis of scale types through the Stevens (1946) typology. I introduce the notion of difference scales using a formalization of this typology. In applying this formalization to the Rasch and 2PL models, I discuss alternate paradigms for conceptualizing the restrictive assumptions of the Rasch model.In the second paper, I apply the Suppes (1958) typology to the two IRT models. The conclusions here echo and reinforce those of the first chapter. In the second half of this paper, I examine other perspectives on connecting scale type theory and the Rasch model, focusing on the case of additive conjoint measurement theory.The first two papers consider the scale types of the odds and logit forms of the models separately. In the third paper, I look at typologies in which the model form is not a factor. The first of these is the axiomatic system of H\"older (1901), which identifies two types of quantities: magnitudes, and points on a line. The second is the homogeneity-uniqueness typology of Narens and Luce (1986), which classifies scales by the types of choices that are possible during the process of numeral assignment.Together, the three papers form an argument for considering psychometric properties behaving as predicted by the Rasch model as having the scale type of ratio scale attributes, while those that behave as predicted by the 2PL model have the scale type of interval scale attributes.},

  abstract = {Objective: While symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and psychological distress (PD) are directly linked, indirect effects are also apparent. The present study aims to develop an explanatory model for the effect of PCOS on women' PD and identify possible protective and risk factors. It examines the development of PD in women with PCOS and further investigates the association between body image, both positive (body appreciation) and negative (body dissatisfaction) dimensions, and PD as well as the potential mediating effect of illness perception on this association. Methods: This study comprised a total of 316 women aged 20--50 (M = 30.9, SD = 6.3) -- 197 women with PCOS and 119 healthy peers---who completed questionnaires regarding demographic characteristics, anxiety (GAD-7), depression (PHQ-9), body appreciation (BAS-2), body dissatisfaction (EDI-BD), and the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (BIPQ). Results: Significant differences between groups were found in all measures. Body appreciation mediated the link between PCOS and PD, while body appreciation and illness perception also mediated the link between symptom level and PD among PCOS patients. Conclusion: Women with PCOS face considerable psychological strain and highlight body appreciation and illness perception as two underlying psychological mechanisms that contribute to the increased risk of distress. Interventions addressing both mechanisms may help improve PD in women with PCOS.},

However, the studies about the differences between men and women in response to an RT program are not conclusive and few data are available about upper body strength response. The aim of this study was to compare elbow flexor strength gains in men and women after 10 weeks of RT. Forty-four college-aged men (22.63 \textpm{} 2.34 years) and forty-seven college-aged women (21.62 \textpm{} 2.96 years) participated in the study. The RT program was performed two days a week for 10 weeks. Before and after the training period, peak torque (PT) of the elbow flexors was measured with an isokinetic dynamometer. PT values were higher in men in comparison to women in pre- and post-tests (p {$<$} 0.01). Both males and females significantly increased elbow flexor strength (p {$<$} 0.05); however, strength changes did not differ between genders after 10 weeks of RT program (11.61 and 11.76\% for men and women, respectively; p {$>$} 0.05). Effect sizes were 0.57 and 0.56 for men and women, respectively. In conclusion, the present study suggests that men and women have a similar upper body strength response to RT.},

Methods: Sixteen men with at least one year of RT experience were divided into two groups, G1 and G2, that trained each muscle group once and twice a week, respectively, for 10 weeks. Elbow flexor muscle thickness (MT) was measured using a B-Mode ultrasound and concentric peak torque of elbow extensors and flexors were assessed by an isokinetic dynamometer. Results: ANOVA did not reveal group by time interactions for any variable, indicating no difference between groups for the changes in MT or PT of elbow flexors and extensors. Notwithstanding, MT of elbow flexors increased significantly (3.1\%, P~{$<~$}0.05) only in G1. PT of elbow flexors and extensors did not increase significantly for any group. Discussion: The present study suggest that there were no differences in the results promoted by equal-volume resistance training performed once or twice a week on upper body muscle strength in trained men. Only the group performing one session per week significantly increased the MT of their elbow flexors. However, with either once or twice a week training, adaptations appear largely minimal in previously trained males.},

Before and after the training period, elbow flexor MT was evaluated by US and AC was measured. We conducted two-stage individual patient data random-effects meta-analyses using both Frequentist and Bayesian hypothesis testing. One-sample analyses examined the absence or presence of a change in both MT and AC, and paired analyses examined whether these differed from one another or equivalent. Results: One-sample analysis supported that both AC (+4.9\%; tp=0.0002; BF10=6,255,759,515) and MT (+3.9\%; P{$<$}0.0001; BF10=7,958,241,773) suggested that change in muscle size had occurred. Frequentist paired comparisons suggested that the estimates of change between both AC and MT measures did not significantly differ (P=0.1092), but were not statistically equivalent. Bayesian paired comparisons, however, suggested that MT estimates where greater in magnitude than AC estimates for change in muscle size (BF10=16.39174). Conclusion: Both MT and AC are able to detect RT-induced changes in muscle size of the upper arm, but that the magnitude of changes may differ. Thus, care should be taken when comparing or combining estimates using either approach. Relevance for patients: The use of AC might be considered as a practical and low-cost alternative to detect changes in muscle size.},

  abstract = {Resistance exercises can be considered to be multi-joint (MJ) or single-joint (SJ) in nature. Many strength coaches, trainers, and trainees believe that adding SJ exercises to a resistance training (RT) program may be required to optimize muscular size and strength. However, given that lack of time is a frequently cited barrier to exercise adoption, the time commitment resulting from these recommendations may not be convenient for many people. Therefore, it is important to find strategies that reduce the time commitment without negatively affecting results. The aim of this review was to analyze and discuss the present body of literature considering the acute responses to and long-term adaptations resulting from SJ and MJ exercise selection. Studies were deemed eligible for inclusion if they were experimental studies comparing the effects of MJ, SJ, or MJ~+~SJ on dependent variables; studies were excluded if they were reviews or abstracts only, if they involved clinical populations or persons with articular or musculoskeletal problems, or if the RT intervention was confounded by other factors. Taking these factors into account, a total of 23 studies were included. For the upper and lower limbs, analysis of surface electromyographic (sEMG) activation suggests that there are no differences between SJ and MJ exercises when comparing the prime movers. However, evidence is contrasting when considering the trunk extensor musculature. Only one study directly compared the effects of MJ and SJ on muscle recovery and the results suggest that SJ exercises resulted in increased muscle fatigue and soreness. Long-term studies comparing increases in muscle size and strength in the upper limbs reported no difference between SJ and MJ exercises and no additional effects when SJ exercises were included in an MJ exercise program. For the lumbar extensors, the studies reviewed tend to support the view that this muscle group may benefit from SJ exercise. People performing RT may not need to include SJ exercises in their program to obtain equivalent results in terms of muscle activation and long-term adaptations such as hypertrophy and strength. SJ exercises may only be necessary to strengthen lumbar extensors and to correct muscular imbalances.},

Twenty-one resistance-trained men (age: 25.7 \textpm{} 5 years; height: 177.0 \textpm{} 7.2 cm; mass: 85.4 \textpm{} 13.56 kg) volunteered to participate in the study. Participants performed 2 test sessions. The first to determine 1-repetition maximum (1RM) load, and the second to evaluate velocity loss during a set to failure performed at 75\% and 50\% of 1RM using a 2-s concentric and 2-s eccentric repetition duration, controlled by a mobile app metronome. When using 75\% 1RM there was a significant loss of movement velocity between the antepenultimate and the penultimate repetition (5.33\%, p {$<$} 0.05), as well as during the penultimate and the last (22.11\%, p {$<$} 0.05). At 50\% of 1RM the participants performed the set until momentary failure without significant velocity loss. Monitoring velocity loss during high-load resistance training through simple methods can be an important tool for standardize the intensity of effort employed during submaximal training. This can be useful in clinical conditions where maximum exertions are contraindicated or when specific logistics are lacking.},

INTERVENTION(S): Assessment of BMR by indirect calorimetry, IR by HOMA and QUICKI indices, fasting insulin, and fasting glucose/insulin ratio. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Reduced BMR in PCOS with or without IR. RESULT(S): Adjusted BMR was 1,868 +/- 41 kcal/day in the control group, 1,445.57 +/- 76 in all PCOS women, 1,590 +/- 130 in PCOS women without IR and 1,116 +/- 106 in PCOS women with IR. Adjusted BMR showed a statistically significant difference between women with PCOS and control subjects, with lowest values in the group of PCOS women with IR, even after adjusting all groups for age and BMI. CONCLUSION(S): Women with PCOS, particularly those with IR, present a significantly decreased BMR.},

  abstract = {The use of Project Gutenberg (PG) as a text corpus has been extremely popular in statistical analysis of language for more than 25 years. However, in contrast to other major linguistic datasets of similar importance, no consensual full version of PG exists to date. In fact, most PG studies so far either consider only a small number of manually selected books, leading to potential biased subsets, or employ vastly different pre-processing strategies (often specified in insufficient details), raising concerns regarding the reproducibility of published results. In order to address these shortcomings, here we present the Standardized Project Gutenberg Corpus (SPGC), an open science approach to a curated version of the complete PG data containing more than 50,000 books and more than     3 \texttimes{}  10 9      word-tokens. Using different sources of annotated metadata, we not only provide a broad characterization of the content of PG, but also show different examples highlighting the potential of SPGC for investigating language variability across time, subjects, and authors. We publish our methodology in detail, the code to download and process the data, as well as the obtained corpus itself on three different levels of granularity (raw text, timeseries of word tokens, and counts of words). In this way, we provide a reproducible, pre-processed, full-size version of Project Gutenberg as a new scientific resource for corpus linguistics, natural language processing, and information retrieval.},

First, the problem of definition is addressed: what does this category of analysis ('description') refer to? Secondly, a taxonomy of descriptive arguments is offered, emphasizing the diversity contained within this genre of empirical analysis. Thirdly, the demise of description within political science is charted over the past century, with comparisons to other disciplines. Fourthly, it is argued that the task of description ought to be approached independently, not merely as a handmaiden of causal theories. Fifthly, the methodological difficulties of descriptive inference are addressed. Finally, fruitful research areas within the rubric of description are reviewed.},

  abstract = {People talk not only to others but also to themselves. The self talk we engage in may be overt or covert, and is associated with a variety of higher mental functions, including reasoning, problem solving, planning and plan execution, attention, and motivation. When talking to herself, a speaker takes devices from her mother tongue, originally designed for interpersonal communication, and employs them to communicate with herself. But what could it even mean to communicate with oneself? To answer that question, we need a theory of communication that explains how the same linguistic devices may be used to communicate with others and oneself. On the received view, which defines communication as information exchange, self talk appears to be an anomaly, for it is hard to see the point of exchanging information with oneself. However, if communication is analysed as a way of negotiating commitments between speaker and hearer, then communication may be useful even when speaker and hearer coincide. Thus a commitment-based approach allows us to make sense of self talk as well as social talk.},

Ecologically valid RT programs more representative of such practices are seldom compared. This study compared two such approaches to RT. Thirty participants (males, n = 13; females, n = 17) were randomised to either a group performing low volume 'High Intensity Training' (HIT; n = 16) or high volume 'Body-building' (3ST; n = 14) RT methods 2x/week for 10 weeks. Outcomes included muscular performance, body composition, and participant's subjective assessments. Both HIT and 3ST groups improved muscular performance significantly (as indicated by 95\% confidence intervals) with large effect sizes (ES; 0.97 to 1.73 and 0.88 to 1.77 respectively). HIT had significantly greater muscular performance gains for 3 of 9 tested exercises compared with 3ST (p {$<$} 0.05) and larger effect sizes for 8 of 9 exercises. Body composition did not significantly change in either group. However, effect sizes for whole body muscle mass changes were slightly more favourable in the HIT group compared with the 3ST group (0.27 and -0.34 respectively) in addition to whole body fat mass (0.03 and 0.43 respectively) and whole body fat percentage (-0.10 and -0.44 respectively). Significant muscular performance gains can be produced using either HIT or 3ST. However, muscular performance gains may be greater when using HIT. Future research should look to identify which components of ecologically valid RT programs are primarily responsible for these differences in outcome.},

  abstract = {AIMS: This study considered the effects of supervised, low volume, high intensity of effort resistance training compared to continued routine care in persons with type II diabetes. METHODS: We utilized a randomized parallel-group time-series design. All participants completed baseline testing (T0) and then participated in an educational training intervention regarding the management of their diabetes and were followed up for six months, during which they received routine care before being retested (T1). Participants were then randomly allocated to either continue with routine care (CON) or receive the high intensity of effort resistance training intervention (HIT). Participants from both groups were retested again after six months (T2). All participants were followed up for a further 12 months before being finally tested (T3). Data were available from 57 participants who completed the whole duration of the study (HIT, n~=~29; CON, n~=~28) for measures of anthropometry (body mass, waist circumference, and BMI), body composition (body fat mass, body fat percentage, lean mass, and visceral fat mass), total body water, phase angle, HbA1c, fasted blood glucose, and subjective wellbeing (WHO-5). RESULTS: During the initial 6-months of routine care significant improvements were noted for waist circumference, body fat mass, lean mass, body fat percentage, lean mass percentage, visceral fat mass, HbA1c, fasted blood glucose, and subjective wellbeing. During the successive 6-months (intervention) and 18-months (follow-up), data suggest that many of these positive changes during the initial 6-months were negated or reversed for CON. In contrast, participants engaging in HIT continued to show positive changes for waist circumference, body fat mass, lean mass, body fat percentage, lean mass percentage, and visceral fat. For blood markers and wellbeing, HbA1c continued to decrease, fasted blood glucose decreased, and subjective wellbeing continued to increase. These positive responses were still evidenced and significantly different compared to CON after the 12-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: The results of this exploratory pragmatic trial suggest that the addition of high intensity of effort RT alongside routine care can have a positive impact on a range of outcomes in type 2 diabetics having undergone prior routine care.},

METHODS: Trained participants (RT experience 4\textpm 3 years) were randomised to groups performing single-set RT: ssRM (N.=21) performing repetitions to self-determined repetition maximum (RM), ssMMF (N.=30) performing repetitions to momentary muscular failure (MMF), and ssRP (N.=28) performing repetitions to self-determined RM using a rest pause (RP) method. Each performed supervised RT twice/week for 10 weeks. Outcomes included maximal isometric strength and body composition using bioelectrical impedance analysis. RESULTS: The ssRM group did not significantly improve in any outcome. The ssMMF and ssRP groups both significantly improved strength (p {$<$} 0.05). Magnitude of changes using effect size (ES) was examined between groups. Strength ES's were considered large for ssMMF (0.91 to 1.57) and ranging small to large for ssRP (0.42 to 1.06). Body composition data revealed significant improvements (P{$<$}0.05) in muscle and fat mass and percentages for whole body, upper limbs and trunk for ssMMF, but only upper limbs for ssRP. Body composition ES's ranged moderate to large for ssMMF (0.56 to 1.27) and ranged small to moderate for ssRP (0.28 to 0.52). ssMMF also significantly improved (P{$<$}0.05) total abdominal fat and increased intracellular water with moderate ES's (-0.62 and 0.56, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Training to self-determined RM is not efficacious for trained participants. Training to MMF produces greatest improvements in strength and body composition, however, RP style training does offer some benefit.},

  abstract = {Objective To evaluate how rating of perceived capacity (RPC) is related to maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) and examine VO2max at onset of training in healthy adults. Methods In total, 125 newly registered fitness centre members, equally men and women, answered the RPC scale and performed a treadmill test for measurement of VO2max. Eligible criteria were {$<$}4 weeks of fitness centre membership, physically inactive, {$\geq$}18 years and not pregnant. The RPC is a one-page scale (1--20) based on metabolic equivalent tasks, where the individual chooses the most strenuous activity that can be sustained for at least 30 min. Results The Bland-Altman plot demonstrated a tendency of overestimation, meaning that the participants ranked their own aerobic capacity 17.5\% higher than objectively measured values of VO2max. The mean difference between the two methods were +4.92\textpm 1.96 and +6.35\textpm 1.96 mL/min/kg VO2 in men and women, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient was moderate, with r=0.426 (p{$<$}0.01). A linear regression analysis showed that both age and VO2max were significant predictors of RPC (p{$<$}0.01). Measured VO2max at onset of fitness centre membership was in men aged 38.7\textpm 11.7 and women aged 34.7\textpm 9.9, 40.5\textpm 7.2 and 35.0\textpm 6.0 mL/min/kg, respectively. Estimated VO2max from the RPC scale was 45.7\textpm 9.8 and 41.4\textpm 10.1 mL/min/kg in men and women, respectively. Conclusions The RPC seems less accurate at the individual level and may overestimate VO2max. Still, it may be considered useful in large-scale studies.},

  abstract = {Sports performance is generally considered to be governed by a range of interacting physiological, biomechanical, and psychological variables, amongst others. Despite sports performance being multi-factorial, however, the majority of performance-oriented sports science research has predominantly been monodisciplinary in nature, presumably due, at least in part, to the lack of a unifying theoretical framework required to integrate the various subdisciplines of sports science. In this target article, I propose a Grand Unified Theory (GUT) of sports performance---and, by elaboration, sports science---based around the constraints framework introduced originally by Newell (1986). A central tenet of this GUT is that, at both the intra- and inter-individual levels of analysis, patterns of coordination and control, which directly determine the performance outcome, emerge from the confluence of interacting organismic, environmental, and task constraints via the formation and self-organisation of coordinative structures. It is suggested that this GUT could be used to: foster interdisciplinary research collaborations; break down the silos that have developed in sports science and restore greater disciplinary balance to the field; promote a more holistic understanding of sports performance across all levels of analysis; increase explanatory power of applied research work; provide stronger rationale for data collection and variable selection; and direct the development of integrated performance monitoring technologies. This GUT could also provide a scientifically rigorous basis for integrating the subdisciplines of sports science in applied sports science support programmes adopted by high-performance agencies and national governing bodies for various individual and team sports.},

Scientific concepts were used to present the body in official texts by authors specializing in the subject, or to describe them, as did Michel Foucault, as epistemic changes. A departure occurred during the 19th century that is clearly demonstrated in the writings of Gustave Adolphe Hirn. This breakthrough concerned the idea of considering the organism as an energy-generating machine. This metaphor was employed in describing the body during physical exercise from the 17th to the 19th centuries, when the body was thought of as mechanical. Such metaphors were used by the most relevant figures writing at the end of the 19th century in the rationale that is examined in this paper. It shows how Hirn, Marey, Lagrange, Demenij, Hebert, and Tissi\'e saw the body and how they employed machine metaphors when referring to it. These machine metaphors are analyzed from the time of their scientific and technological origins up to their current use in physical and sports education. This analysis will contribute to the understanding of how a scientific metaphor comes to be in common use and may lead to particular exercise practices.},

METHODS: National register-based study including women with PCOS and no previous diagnosis of CVD, hypertension, or dyslipidemia. PCOS Denmark (N\,=\,18,112) included women with PCOS in the Danish National Patient Register. PCOS Odense University Hospital (OUH, N\,=\,1165) was an embedded cohort including premenopausal women with PCOS and clinical and biochemical examination. Three age-matched controls were included per patient in PCOS Denmark (N\,=\,52,769). The main study outcome was CVD events including hypertension and dyslipidemia defined according to nationwide in- and outpatient hospital contact diagnosis codes and/or inferred from filled medicine prescriptions. RESULTS: The age at inclusion was median (quartiles) 29 (23-35) years and follow up was 11.1 (6.9-16.0) years. The Hazard ratio (95\% CI) for development of CVD in PCOS Denmark was 1.7 (1.7; 1.8) (P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and the total event rate of CVD was 22.6 per 1000 patient years in PCOS Denmark vs. 13.2 per 1000 patient years in controls (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). The median age at diagnosis of CVD was 35 (28-42) years in PCOS Denmark vs. 36 (30-43) years in controls (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Obesity, diabetes, and infertility, and previous use of oral contraceptives were associated with increased risk of development of CVD in PCOS Denmark (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Women in PCOS OUH resembled women in PCOS Denmark regarding risk of CVD. Age, BMI, blood pressure, lipid status, and glycemic status predicted development of CVD in PCOS OUH. CONCLUSION: The event rate of CVD including hypertension and dyslipidemia was higher in PCOS compared to controls. The risk of developing CVD must be considered even in young women with PCOS.},

  abstract = {Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is associated with obesity and increased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, the prospective risk of T2D in normal weight women with PCOS is debated, together with the relevant prospective screening programs for T2D in normal weight women with PCOS. Aim: To review and discuss prospective risk of T2D in normal weight women with PCOS, and to give recommendations regarding prospective screening for T2D in normal weight women with PCOS. Methods: Systematic review. Results: A systematic literature search resulted in 15 published prospective studies (10 controlled studies and 5 uncontrolled studies) regarding risk of T2D in study cohorts of PCOS, where data from normal weight women with PCOS were presented separately. In controlled studies, higher risk of T2D in normal weight women with PCOS compared to controls was reported in 4/10 studies, which included one study where T2D diagnosis was based on glucose measurement, two register-based studies, and one study where diagnosis of T2D was self-reported. Six of the 10 controlled studies reported no increased risk of T2D in normal weight women with PCOS. Four of these studies based the diagnosis of T2D on biochemical measurements, which supported the risk of surveillance bias in PCOS. In uncontrolled studies, 2/5 reported a higher risk of T2D in lean women with PCOS compared to the general population. We discuss the evidence for insulin resistance and {$\beta$}-cell dysfunction in normal weight women with PCOS, and aggravation in the hyperandrogenic phenotype, ageing women, and women with Asian ethnicity. Impaired glucose tolerance could be an important metabolic and vascular risk marker in PCOS. Conclusions: The risk of T2D may be increased in some normal weight women with PCOS. Individual risk markers such as hyperandrogenism, age {$>$}40 years, Asian ethnicity, and weight gain should determine prospective screening programs in normal weight women with PCOS.},

  abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: What is the prospective risk of Type 2 diabetes (T2D) in Nordic women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared to controls? SUMMARY ANSWER: A diagnosis of PCOS and BMI {$\geq$}30\,kg/m2 is a high-risk phenotype for a prospective risk of T2D diagnosis across Nordic countries. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The risk of T2D in women with PCOS is increased. The risk of T2D is related to BMI and the magnitude of risk in normal weight women with PCOS has been discussed. However, prospective data regarding risk of T2D in population-based cohorts of women with PCOS are limited. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This national register-based study included women with PCOS and age-matched controls. The main study outcome was T2D diagnosis occurring after PCOS diagnosis. T2D was defined according to ICD-10 diagnosis codes and/or filled medicine prescriptions of anti-diabetic medication excluding metformin. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study cohort included women originating from Denmark (PCOS Denmark, N\,=\,27~016; controls, N\,=\,133~994), Finland (PCOS Finland, N\,=\,20~467; controls, N\,=\,58~051), and Sweden (PCOS Sweden, N\,=\,52~409; controls, N\,=\,254~010). The median age at cohort entry was 28\,years in PCOS Denmark, Finland, and Sweden with a median follow-up time (interquartile range) in women with PCOS of 8.5 (4.0-14.8), 9.8 (5.1-15.1), and 6.0 (2.0-10.0) years, respectively. Cox regression analyses were adjusted for BMI and length of education. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The crude hazard ratio (HR, 95\% CI) for T2D diagnosis in women with PCOS was 4.28 (3.98-4.60) in Denmark, 3.40 (3.11-3.74) in Finland, and 5.68 (5.20-6.21) in Sweden. In adjusted regression analyses, BMI {$\geq$}30 vs {$<$}25\,kg/m2 was associated with a 7.6- to 11.3-fold risk of T2D. In a combined meta-analysis (PCOS, N\,=\,99~892; controls, N\,=\,446~055), the crude HR for T2D in PCOS was 4.64 (3.40-5.87) and, after adjustment for BMI and education level, the HR was 2.92 (2.32-3.51). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Inclusion of more severe cases of PCOS in the present study design could have lead to an overestimation of risk estimates in our exposed population. However, some women in the control group would have undiagnosed PCOS, which would lead to an underestimation of T2D risk in women with PCOS. BMI data were not available for all participants. The present study should be repeated in study cohorts with higher background risks of T2D, particularly in populations of other ethnicities. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The prospective risk for diagnosis of T2D is increased in women with PCOS, and the risk is aggravated in women with BMI {$\geq$}30\,kg/m2. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): Funding in Denmark was from the Region of Southern Denmark, Overl\ae ger\aa det, Odense University Hospital.

Ten recreationally active participants (males; n=5, and females; n=5) had their lower limbs randomly allocated to perform both unilateral MJ (leg press; LP) and unilateral SJ (knee extension; KE, and seated knee flexion; KF) exercises. Participants trained 2 d.week-1 for 6 weeks. Pre- and post-intervention maximal strength (1-repetition maximum; 1RM) was measured for leg press, knee extension, and seated knee flexion exercises. Statistically significant strength increases occurred for both SJ and MJ groups, with significantly greater increases in 1RM for the MJ compared to the SJ group (p {$<$} 0.001 for all exercises). This study supports the use of MJ exercise for strength increases across lower body MJ and SJ movements, suggesting a time-efficient, and simple approach to resistance training may be efficacious. This might serve to promote greater adherence in the lay population as well as serving useful for rehabilitation professionals and strength and conditioning coaches in managing resistance exercise around skill/sport specific training.},

Partial range of motion exercise is effective for facilitating muscle hypertrophy and function through sustained intramuscular hypoxia in young trained men. J Strength Cond Res 33(5): 1286--1294, 2019---The acute response to and long-term effects of partial range of motion exercise (PRE) and full range of motion exercise (FRE) of elbow extensors were compared in young trained men. The PRE was expected to increase the intramuscular hypoxic environment, which was theorized to enhance muscular hypertrophy. Forty-four resistance-trained men were divided into 2 training groups, PRE ( n = 22) or FRE ( n = 22) group, and performed the PRE or FRE acute exercise protocol. The PRE (elbow range from 45{$^\circ$} to 90{$^\circ$}) and FRE (from 0{$^\circ$} to 120{$^\circ$}) acute protocols consisted of 3 sets of 8 repetitions, with an 8RM, and an equivalent workload. After the initial testing, the training program for each group, comprised 3 training sessions per week for 8 weeks, was started. The acute responses of area under the oxygenated hemoglobin (Oxy-Hb) curve, blood lactate concentration, and root mean square of electromyography were significantly higher both before and after PRE than FRE training. Long-term effects were produced by both PRE and FRE, with significant ( p {$\leq$} 0.05) increases in cross-sectional area (CSA) of triceps brachii and isometric strength. The CSA increased significantly greater after PRE (48.7 \textpm{} 14.5\%) than after FRE (28.2 \textpm{} 10.9\%). Furthermore, during the PRE program, a positive correlation was detected between the percent increase in CSA and area under the Oxy-Hb curves before and after 8-week exercise training (before 8-week exercise training: r = 0.59, after 8-week exercise training: r = 0.70, p {$<$} 0.01). These results suggest that intramuscular hypoxia might facilitate muscular hypertrophy with PRE being more effective than FRE.},

INTERVENTION(S): Metabolic work-up, biochemical and hormonal assays, assessment of body composition and rest metabolic rate, physical activity (pedometer), and food consumption (food frequency questionnaire). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): GI, glycemic load, dietary intake, and hormone and metabolic profile in PCOS versus control and in PCOS women stratified by tertiles of GI and PCOS phenotype. RESULT(S): Mean age was 23.7 \textpm{} 6.3 years. Participants with PCOS had higher body fat percentage, fasting insulin, insulin resistance, lipid accumulation product, and androgen levels compared with control women. PCOS and control women in the highest tertile of GI had higher body mass index and waist circumference than those in the lowest tertile. Dietary GI was higher in the classic PCOS group. Obesity and this more severe PCOS phenotype explained 28.3\% of variance in dietary GI. CONCLUSION(S): Dietary GI is increased in the classic PCOS phenotype and associated with a less favorable anthropometric and metabolic profile. Obesity and classic PCOS phenotype are age-independent predictors of higher dietary GI.},

METHODS: Biochemical/hormonal profile, resting metabolic rate, physical activity, HRV in response to the Stroop test, and dietary intake were assessed in 84 PCOS and 54 control women stratified by median SFA intake in the PCOS group (8.5\% of daily energy intake). RESULTS: Body mass index (p~= 0.041), blood pressure (p~{$<$} 0.01), and HOMA-IR (p~= 0.003) were higher in PCOS vs. CONTROLS: PCOS women had higher testosterone (p~= 0.001), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (p~= 0.012), and free androgen index (p~= 0.001), and lower sex hormone-binding globulin levels than controls (p~= 0.001). In both groups, the clinical profile and calorie intake were similar between SFA categories. In PCOS, testosterone was lower when SFA intake {$<$}8.5\%. PCOS women with SFA {$<$}8.5\% consumed more beans, fruits, and vegetables and had better frequency and time domain HRV indices. No differences in HRV were detected between SFA categories in controls. In PCOS, age and SFA intake were independent predictors of HRV. CONCLUSIONS: Lower SFA intake is related to improved cardiovascular autonomic function in PCOS.},

However, direct comparisons of NW with normal walking (W), particularly in ecologically valid environments is lacking. The aim of our study was to compare NW and W, over long distances in a natural mountain environment. Methods: Twenty one subjects (13 male/8 female, aged 41 \textpm{} 12 years, body mass index BMI 24.1 \textpm{} 3.7), walked three distinct uphill paths (length 2.2/3.4/7 km) with (NW) or without (W) walking poles over two separate days. Heart rate (HR), energy expenditure (EE), step length (SL), walking speed (WS), total steps number (SN) and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were monitored. Results: HR (+18\%) and EE (+20\%) were higher in NW than in W whilst RPE was similar. SN (-12\%) was lower and SL (+15\%) longer in NW. WS was higher (1.64 vs. 1.53 m s-1) in NW. Conclusions: Our data confirm that, similarly to previous laboratory studies, differences in a range of walking variables are present between NW and W when performed in a natural environment. NW appears to increase EE compared to W, despite a similar RPE. Thus, NW could be a useful as aerobic training modality for weight control and cardiorespiratory fitness.},

Twenty-eight men and 31 women were randomly assigned to one of the three training groups (A, B, AB) or a control group (C). A, B, and AB performed variable resistance bilateral knee extension exercise 2 (N = 25) or 3 (N = 19) d.wk-1 for 10 wk with an amount of weight that allowed one set of 7-10 repetitions. Group A trained in a ROM limited to 120 degrees to 60 degrees of knee flexion. Group B trained in a ROM limited to 60 degrees to 0 degrees of knee flexion. Group AB trained full ROM. Prior to and immediately following training, isometric knee extension strength was evaluated at 9 degrees, 20 degrees, 35 degrees, 50 degrees, 65 degrees, 80 degrees, 95 degrees, and 110 degrees of knee flexion with a Nautilus knee extension tensiometer. Reliability coefficients for repeated measurements of isometric strength at multiple joint angles were high (r = 0.86-0.95, P less than 0.01; SEE = 23.1-37.2 N.m). Compared to the control group, all training groups improved in isometric strength (P less than 0.01 at each angle tested except for group A at 9 degrees and 20 degrees of knee flexion and group B at 95 degrees of flexion. Isometric strength gains for group AB were similar throughout the full ROM. Isometric strength gains for the limited ROM trained groups were greater in the trained ROM than in the untrained ROM (P less than 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Prior exercise has previously been shown to impair subsequent endurance performance in non-activated muscles. Declines in the neuromuscular function and altered perceptual/affective responses offer possible mechanisms through which endurance performance may be limited in these remote muscle groups. We thus conducted two experiments to better understand these performance-limiting mechanisms. In the first experiment, we examined the effect of prior handgrip exercise on the behavioral, perceptual, and affective responses to a sustained, sub-maximal contraction of the knee extensors. In the second experiment, transcranial magnetic stimulation was used to assess the neuromuscular function of the knee extensors before and after the handgrip exercise. The results of the first experiment demonstrated prior handgrip exercise increased the perceptions of effort and reduced affective valence during the subsequent knee extensor endurance exercise. Both effort and affect were associated with endurance performance. Subjective ratings of fatigue were also increased by the preceding handgrip exercise but were not directly related to knee extensor endurance performance. However, perceptions of fatigue were correlated with heightened effort perception and reduced affect during the knee extensor contraction. In the second experiment, prior handgrip exercise did not significantly alter the neuromuscular function of the knee extensors. The findings of the present study indicate that motor performance in the lower limbs following demanding exercise in the upper body appears to be regulated by complex, cognitive-emotional interactions, which may emerge independent of altered neuromuscular function. Subjective fatigue states are implicated in the control of perceptual and affective processes responsible for the regulation of endurance performance.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Resistance training is often performed in a traditional training style using deliberate relatively longer repetition durations or in an explosive training style using maximal intended velocities and relatively shorter repetition durations. Both improve strength, "power" (impulsivity), and speed. This study compared explosive and traditional training over a 6-week intervention in 30 healthy young adult male recreational soccer players. METHOD: Full body supervised resistance training was performed 2 times a week using 3 sets of each exercise at 80\% of one repetition maximum to momentary failure. Outcomes were Smith machine squat 1~repetition maximum, 10~meter sprint time, and countermovement jump. RESULTS: Both groups significantly improved all outcomes based on 95\% confidence intervals not crossing zero. There were no between-group differences for squat 1~RM (TRAD~=~6.3[5.1 to 7.6] kg, EXP~=~5.2[3.9 to 6.4] kg) or 10~meter sprint (TRAD~=~-0.05[-0.07 to -0.04] s, EXP~=~-0.05[-0.06 to -0.03] s). Explosive group had a significantly greater increase in countermovement jump compared to the traditional group (TRAD~=~0.7[0.3 to 1.1] cm, EXP~=~1.3[0.9 to 1.7] cm). CONCLUSION: Both the traditional training and explosive training performed to momentary failure produced significant improvements in strength, speed, and jump performance. Strength gains are similar independent of intended movement speed. However, speed and jump performance changes are marginal with resistance training.},

Participants were divided into two groups: a kettlebell group (n = 13), that followed a commercial kettlebell training protocol named the "Simple \& Sinister protocol", and a traditional dance training control group (n = 10). In the kettlebell group, kettlebell training completely replaced the jump and balance section of dance classes. Both groups performed balance and jumping tests before and after the training period. Blood pressure and the heart rate were also measured. The kettlebell group showed significant improvements in the balance tests (antero-posterior and medio-lateral oscillation) with both legs and eyes open as well as in all types of jump exercises (unrotated: +39.13\%, p {$<$} 0.005; with a turnout: +53.15\%, p {$<$} 0.005), while maximum and minimum blood pressure and the heart rate decreased significantly (max: -7.90\%, p {$<$} 0.05; min: -9.86\%, p {$<$} 0.05; Heart rate: -17.07\%, p {$<$} 0.01). The results for the control group were non-significant for any variable. Comparison between groups showed significant differences for all variables analyzed, with greater improvements for the kettlebell group. Our results suggest that specific kettlebell training could be effective in improving jump performance and balance in classical dancers to a significantly greater degree compared to classical dance training.},

  abstract = {Psychology endeavors to develop theories of human capacities and behaviors on the basis of a variety of methodologies and dependent measures. We argue that one of the most divisive factors in psychological science is whether researchers choose to use computational modeling of theories (over and above data) during the scientific-inference process. Modeling is undervalued yet holds promise for advancing psychological science. The inherent demands of computational modeling guide us toward better science by forcing us to conceptually analyze, specify, and formalize intuitions that otherwise remain unexamined---what we dub open theory. Constraining our inference process through modeling enables us to build explanatory and predictive theories. Here, we present scientific inference in psychology as a path function in which each step shapes the next. Computational modeling can constrain these steps, thus advancing scientific inference over and above the stewardship of experimental practice (e.g., preregistration). If psychology continues to eschew computational modeling, we predict more replicability crises and persistent failure at coherent theory building. This is because without formal modeling we lack open and transparent theorizing. We also explain how to formalize, specify, and implement a computational model, emphasizing that the advantages of modeling can be achieved by anyone with benefit to all.},

This essay explores the use of a distinctiveness algorithm from library science for measuring the distinctiveness of manuscripts, tf-idf, recast as "tf-ipf" for the study of the terms most distinctive of historical periods. In a case study, tf-ipf is applied to the text of Hansard's Parliamentary Debates, varying the "period" from a 20-year horizon to a 6-month or one-day horizon. It is shown that the algorithm's assessments of what is most distinctive of 20-year and 10-year periods largely matches the consensus of British historians, while debates that held parliament's attention for six months or fewer have largely fallen beneath the threshold of scholarly attention. Attending to concerns that took up parliamentary debate for six months or fewer, the essay argues that tf-ipf thus presents a metric of parliamentary attention that mirrors the exclusions of class, allowing scholars to retrieve a timeline of when the concerns of the distillers, bleachers, dyers, Chartists, crofters, and miners reached a national debate. More generally, tf-ipf represents an important new tool for discovering the distinctive aspects of historical periods based on past experience, not historical bias.},

I will then point out the distinction between forward and reverse modeling and focus thereafter on the former. Instead of going into mathematical technicalities about different varieties of models, I will focus on their logical structure, in terms of assumptions and conclusions. A model is a logical machine for deducing the latter from the former. If the model is correct, then, if you believe its assumptions, you must, as a matter of logic, also believe its conclusions. This leads to consideration of the assumptions underlying models. If these are based on fundamental physical laws, then it may be reasonable to treat the model as `predictive', in the sense that it is not subject to falsification and we can rely on its conclusions. However, at the molecular level, models are more often derived from phenomenology and guesswork. In this case, the model is a test of its assumptions and must be falsifiable. I will discuss three models from this perspective, each of which yields biological insights, and this will lead to some guidelines for prospective model builders.},

  abstract = {Background The pathway from evidence generation to consumption contains many steps which can lead to overstatement or misinformation. The proliferation of internet-based health news may encourage selection of media and academic research articles that overstate strength of causal inference. We investigated the state of causal inference in health research as it appears at the end of the pathway, at the point of social media consumption. Methods We screened the NewsWhip Insights database for the most shared media articles on Facebook and Twitter reporting about peer-reviewed academic studies associating an exposure with a health outcome in 2015, extracting the 50 most-shared academic articles and media articles covering them. We designed and utilized a review tool to systematically assess and summarize studies' strength of causal inference, including generalizability, potential confounders, and methods used. These were then compared with the strength of causal language used to describe results in both academic and media articles. Two randomly assigned independent reviewers and one arbitrating reviewer from a pool of 21 reviewers assessed each article. Results We accepted the most shared 64 media articles pertaining to 50 academic articles for review, representing 68\% of Facebook and 45\% of Twitter shares in 2015. Thirty-four percent of academic studies and 48\% of media articles used language that reviewers considered too strong for their strength of causal inference. Seventy percent of academic studies were considered low or very low strength of inference, with only 6\% considered high or very high strength of causal inference. The most severe issues with academic studies' causal inference were reported to be omitted confounding variables and generalizability. Fifty-eight percent of media articles were found to have inaccurately reported the question, results, intervention, or population of the academic study. Conclusions We find a large disparity between the strength of language as presented to the research consumer and the underlying strength of causal inference among the studies most widely shared on social media. However, because this sample was designed to be representative of the articles selected and shared on social media, it is unlikely to be representative of all academic and media work. More research is needed to determine how academic institutions, media organizations, and social network sharing patterns impact causal inference and language as received by the research consumer.},

'Representing' deals with the different philosophical accounts of scientific objectivity and the reality of scientific entities. The views of Kuhn, Feyerabend, Lakatos, Putnam, van Fraassen, and others, are all considered. 'Intervening' presents the first sustained treatment of experimental science for many years and uses it to give a new direction to debates about realism. Hacking illustrates how experimentation often has a life independent of theory. He argues that although the philosophical problems of scientific realism can not be resolved when put in terms of theory alone, a sound philosophy of experiment provides compelling grounds for a realistic attitude. A great many scientific examples are described in both parts of the book, which also includes lucid expositions of recent high energy physics and a remarkable chapter on the microscope in cell biology.},

  abstract = {Background Reporting standards, such as PRISMA aim to ensure that the methods and results of systematic reviews are described in sufficient detail to allow full transparency. Flow diagrams in evidence syntheses allow the reader to rapidly understand the core procedures used in a review and examine the attrition of irrelevant records throughout the review process. Recent research suggests that use of flow diagrams in systematic reviews is poor and of low quality and called for standardised templates to facilitate better reporting in flow diagrams. The increasing options for interactivity provided by the Internet gives us an opportunity to support easy-to-use evidence synthesis tools, and here we report on the development of a tool for the production of PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review flow diagrams. Methods and Findings We developed a free-to-use, Open Source R package and web-based Shiny app to allow users to design PRISMA flow diagrams for their own systematic reviews. Our tool allows users to produce standardised visualisations that transparently document the methods and results of a systematic review process in a variety of formats. In addition, we provide the opportunity to produce interactive, web-based flow diagrams (exported as HTML files), that allow readers to click on boxes of the diagram and navigate to further details on methods, results or data files. We provide an interactive example here; https://prisma-flowdiagram.github.io/. Conclusions We have developed a user-friendly tool for producing PRISMA 2020-compliant flow diagrams for users with coding experience and, importantly, for users without prior experience in coding by making use of Shiny (https://estech.shinyapps.io/prisma\_flowdiagram/). This free-to-use tool will make it easier to produce clear and PRISMA 2020-compliant systematic review flow diagrams. Significantly, users can also produce interactive flow diagrams for the first time, allowing readers of their reviews to smoothly and swiftly explore and navigate to further details of the methods and results of a review. We believe this tool will increase use of PRISMA flow diagrams, improve the compliance and quality of flow diagrams, and facilitate strong science communication of the methods and results of systematic reviews by making use of interactivity. We encourage the systematic review community to make use of the tool, and provide feedback to streamline and improve their usability and efficiency.},

A total of 12 healthy adults and volunteers, who had previously practiced endurance activities for 4 to 8 h per week, performed a one-hour cognitive task involving either the process of response inhibition (Stroop task) or not (visualization of a documentary as control task), then 20 min of pedaling on a cycle ergometer at a constant perception of effort while cardio-respiratory and neuromuscular functions were measured. The Stroop task induces subjective feelings of mental fatigue (vigor: 3.92 \textpm{} 2.61; subjective workload: 58.61 \textpm{} 14.57) compared to the control task (vigor: 5.67 \textpm{} 3.26; p = 0.04; subjective workload: 32.5 \textpm{} 10.1; p = 0.005). This fatigue did not act on the produced perceived effort, self-imposed, and did not affect the cardio-respiratory or neuromuscular functions during the subsequent physical task whose type was medium-term endurance. Regardless of the mental condition, the intensity of physical effort is better controlled when the participants in physical activity control their perception of effort. Mental fatigue does not affect subsequent physical performance but estimated perceived exertion, which increases with the intensity and duration of the exercise.},

  abstract = {Background Aerobic exercise interventions have been shown to result in alterations to dietary intake and non-exercise physical activity (PA). To date, the ability for resistance training (RT) to influence other health-related behaviors has not been examined. This study aimed to determine if initiation and maintenance of RT is associated with spontaneous changes in dietary quality and non-RT PA in adults with prediabetes. Methods Overweight/obese adults (n=170, BMI=32.9\textpm 3.8kg{$\cdot$}m2, age=59.5\textpm 5.5years, 73\% female) with prediabetes were enrolled in the 15-month Resist Diabetes trial. Participants completed a supervised 3-month RT initiation phase followed by a 6-month maintenance phase and a 6-month no-contact phase. Participants were not encouraged to change eating or non-RT PA behaviors. At baseline, and months 3, 9, and 15, three 24-hour diet recalls were collected to evaluate dietary intake and quality, the Aerobics Institute Longitudinal Study Questionnaire was completed to evaluate non-RT PA, and body mass, body composition (DXA), and muscular strength were measured. At months 3, 9, and 15 social cognitive theory (SCT) constructs were assessed with a RT Health Beliefs Questionnaire. Mixed effects models were used to assess changes in dietary intake and non-RT PA over the 15-month study period. Results Energy and carbohydrate intake decreased with RT initiation and maintenance phases (baseline to month 9: {$\beta$}=-87.9, p=0.015 and {$\beta$}=-16.3, p{$<$}0.001, respectively). No change in overall dietary quality (Healthy Eating Index [HEI]-2010 score: {$\beta$}=-0.13, p=0.722) occurred, but alterations in HEI-2010 sub-scores were detected. Maintenance of RT was accompanied by an increase in MET-min/week of total non-RT PA (month 3 to month 9: {$\beta$}=146.2, p=0.01), which was predicted by increased self-regulation and decreased negative outcome expectancies for RT ({$\beta$}=83.7, p=0.014 and {$\beta$}=-70.0, p=0.038, respectively). Conclusions Initiation and maintenance of RT may be a gateway behavior leading to improvements in other health-related behaviors. These results provide rationale for single-component lifestyle interventions as an alternative to multi-component interventions, when resources are limited.},

We define effort in a way that applies to all biological entities, voluntary and involuntary actions, and successful and unsuccessful actions. We define perception of effort such that it builds on our definition of effort without conflating it with other experiences. Our definition of perception of effort also aligns with various explanations regarding its proposed functions and mechanistic underpinnings. We explore the latent nature of these constructs, their employment as independent and dependent variables, and their associations. Our framework also seeks to bridge the gap between cognitive and physical effort and perception of effort, which have been primarily developed in isolation. We anticipate that our framework will facilitate a deeper understanding of these constructs, refine research methodologies and promote interdisciplinary collaborations.},

They offer an easy and useful way to monitor and prescribe exercise intensity. However, RPE scales suffer from methodological limitations stemming from multiple perceived effort definitions and measurement strategies. In the present review, we attend these issues by covering (1) two popular perceived effort definitions, (2) the terms included within these definitions and the reasons they can impede validity, (3) the problems associated with using different effort scales and instructions, and (4) measuring perceived effort from specific body parts and the body as a whole. We pose that the large number of interactions between definitions, scales, instructions and applications strategies, threatens measurement validity of RPE. We suggest two strategies to overcome these limitations: (1) to reinforce consistency by narrowing the number of definitions of perceived effort, the number of terms included within them, and the number of scales and instructions used. (2) Rather than measuring solely RPE as commonly done, exercise sciences will benefit from incorporating other single-item scales that measure affect, fatigue and discomfort, among others. By following these two recommendations, we expect the field will increase measurement validity and become more comprehensive.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Common exercises such as the barbell back squat (BBS) and barbell hip thrust (BHT) are perceived to provide a training stimulus to the lumbar extensors. However, to date there have been no empirical studies considering changes in lumbar extension strength as a result of BBS or BHT resistance training (RT) interventions. Purpose: To consider the effects of BBS and BHT RT programmes upon isolated lumbar extension (ILEX) strength. Methods: Trained male subjects (n = 14; 22.07 \textpm{} 0.62 years; 179.31 \textpm{} 6.96 cm; 79.77 \textpm{} 13.81 kg) were randomised in to either BBS (n = 7) or BHT (n = 7) groups and performed two training sessions per week during a 4-week mesocycle using 80\% of their 1RM. All subjects were tested pre- and post-intervention for BBS and BHT 1RM as well as isometric ILEX strength. Results: Analyses revealed that both BBS and BHT groups significantly improved both their BBS and BHT 1RM, suggesting a degree of transferability. However, the BBS group improved their BBS 1RM to a greater degree than the BHT group (p = 0.050; {$\sim$}11.8 kg/10.2\% vs. {$\sim$}8.6 kg/7.7\%, respectively). And the BHT group improved their BHT 1RM to a greater degree than the BBS group (p = 0.034; {$\sim$}27.5 kg/24.8\% vs. {$\sim$}20.3 kg/13.3\%, respectively). Neither BBS nor BHT groups significantly improved their isometric ILEX strength. Conclusions: The present study supports the concept of specificity, particularly in relation to the movement mechanics between trunk extension (including pelvic rotation) and ILEX. Our data suggest that strength coaches, personal trainers, and trainees can self-select multi-joint lower-body trunk extension exercises based on preference or variety. However, evidence suggests that neither the BBS nor BHT exercises can meaningfully increase ILEX strength. Since strengthening these muscles might enhance physical and sporting performance we encourage strength coaches and personal trainers to prescribe ILEX exercise.},

  abstract = {The perception of effort during exercise and its relationship to fatigue is still not well understood. Although several scales have been developed to quantify exertion Borg's 15-point ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) scale has been adopted as a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating whole body exertion during exercise. However, Borg's category-ratio scale is useful in quantifying sensations of exertion related to those variables that rise exponentially with increases in exercise intensity. Previous research has examined the extent to which afferent feedback arising from cardiopulmonary and peripheral variables mediates the perception of exertion. However, the literature has not identified a single variable that consistently explains exertion ratings. It is concluded that effort perception involves the integration of multiple afferent signals from a variety of perceptual cues. In a process defined as teleoanticipation, the changes in perceived exertion that result from these afferent signals may allow exercise performance to be precisely regulated such that a task can be completed within the biomechanical and metabolic limits of the body. The accuracy with which individuals can regulate exercise intensity based upon RPE values, the decrease in muscle recruitment (central drive) that occurs before fatigue, and the extent to which perceived exertion and heart rate can be altered with hypnosis and biofeedback training all provide evidence for the existence of such a regulatory system. Future research is needed to precisely quantify the extent to which efferent feedforward commands and afferent feedback determine pacing strategies such that an exercise event can be completed without irreversible tissue damage.},

Healthy, inactive adults (n = 50) aged 65 years and older underwent strength, power, total body composition (\% fat and fat free mass [FFM]), and physical function testing before and after 22 weeks of ST. Physical function testing consisted of tasks designed to mimic common physical activities of daily living (ADL). To improve internal validity of the assessment of mid-thigh intermuscular fat, subcutaneous fat, and knee extensors MV, a 10-week unilateral ST program using the untrained leg as an internal control preceded 12 weeks of whole-body ST. Strength, power, and FFM increased significantly with ST (all p {$<$} 0.05), whereas rapid walk, 5 chair stands, and get up and go time decreased significantly with ST in the overall group (all p {$<$} 0.05). Women improved significantly in both walking test times (both p {$<$} 0.05) but not in the stair climb test, whereas men improved in the stair climb test (p {$<$} 0.05) but not in walking test times. Multiple regression analysis revealed the highest R (0.28) for the change in chair stands time, followed by stair climb and usual walk at 0.27 and 0.21, respectively. ST improves performance in functional tasks important for ADLs. Changes in strength, power, and FFM are predictors of ST-induced improvements in these tasks.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Skeletal muscle is highly adaptable and has consistently been shown to morphologically respond to exercise training. Skeletal muscle growth during periods of resistance training has traditionally been referred to as skeletal muscle hypertrophy, and this manifests as increases in muscle mass, muscle thickness, muscle area, muscle volume, and muscle fiber cross-sectional area (fCSA). Delicate electron microscopy and biochemical techniques have also been used to demonstrate that resistance exercise promotes ultrastructural adaptations within muscle fibers. Decades of research in this area of exercise physiology have promulgated a widespread hypothetical model of training-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy; specifically, fCSA increases are accompanied by proportional increases in myofibrillar protein, leading to an expansion in the number of sarcomeres in parallel and/or an increase in myofibril number. However, there is ample evidence to suggest that myofibrillar protein concentration may be diluted through sarcoplasmic expansion as fCSA increases occur. Furthermore, and perhaps more problematic, are numerous investigations reporting that pre-to-post training change scores in macroscopic, microscopic, and molecular variables supporting this model are often poorly associated with one another. The current review first provides a brief description of skeletal muscle composition and structure. We then provide a historical overview of muscle hypertrophy assessment. Next, current-day methods commonly used to assess skeletal muscle hypertrophy at the biochemical, ultramicroscopic, microscopic, macroscopic, and whole-body levels in response to training are examined. Data from our laboratory, and others, demonstrating correlations (or the lack thereof) between these variables are also presented, and reasons for comparative discrepancies are discussed with particular attention directed to studies reporting ultrastructural and muscle protein concentration alterations. Finally, we critically evaluate the biological construct of skeletal muscle hypertrophy, propose potential operational definitions, and provide suggestions for consideration in hopes of guiding future research in this area.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

The distinction between a prediction of the appearance of a pattern of a certain class and a prediction of the appearance of a particular instance of this class is sometimes important also in the physical sciences. The distinction between simplicity and complexity raises considerable philosophical difficulties when applied to statements. The multiplicity of even the minimum of distinct elements required to produce a complex phenomenon of a particular kind creates problems which dominate the disciplines concerned with these phenomena, and makes such disciplines appear very different from those concerned with simpler phenomena.},

The search identified 5613 articles that were reviewed for physical assessment results stratified by sex and age. Maximal isometric and isokinetic 60{$^\circ\cdot$}s-1 knee extension (KE) and knee flexion (KF) contractions from 57 studies and 15\,283 subjects (N = 7918 females) had sufficient data reported on females and males for meaningful statistical evaluation to be undertaken.

Yet, there is an abrupt age-related decline in KE 60{$^\circ\cdot$}s-1 peak torque earlier in females (aged 41.8 years) than males (aged 66.7 years). In the assessment of KF peak torque, an age-related acceleration in strength loss was only identified in males (aged 49.3 years).

This paper gives a broad overview of the development of stellar spectroscopy, especially from about 1860. Developments in stellar spectroscopy segregated quite clearly into three main fields of endeavour: spectral classification, radial velocities and spectral analysis. This paper concentrates mainly on spectral analysis, or how stellar spectroscopy one hundred years after Comte showed that quantitative information on the composition of stars was possible. The journey was quite arduous, as it required numerous developments in theoretical physics and in laboratory spectroscopy, which in turn allowed stellar spectral analysis successfully to be undertaken by the mid-twentieth century.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The key developments in physics that first had to be understood were in quantum and atomic theory, ionization theory, the concept of the Planck function, local thermodynamic equilibrium, the first stellar model atmospheres, line formation theory, turbulence, collisional broadening of spectral lines and the theory of radiative transfer and of the curve of growth. The close links between stellar spectroscopy and theoretical physics will be emphasized. In addition laboratory physics, to measure line wavelengths and oscillator strengths, was also an essential precursor to quantitative data on the chemical composition of stars.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}Comte may have been an influential philosopher of science in his time. Perhaps his one small transgression was not to have read the works of Joseph Fraunhofer, which in the early nineteenth century already contained the first small clues that Comte's assertion might be wrong.},

However, standard approaches for quantification and prediction remain to be established, probably due to the specific considerations associated with interactive effects, in particular on the individual level, compared with the prevailing investigation of main effects. Regarding the quantification of subject-by-training interaction in terms of variance components, confounding sources of variability have to be considered. Clearly, measurement error limits the accuracy of response estimates and thereby contributes to variation. This problem is of particular importance for analyses on the individual level, because a low signal-to-noise ratio may not be compensated by increasing sample size (1 case). Moreover, within-subject variation in training efficacy may contribute to gross response variability. This largely unstudied source of variation may not be disclosed by comparison to a control group but calls for repeated interventions. A second critical point concerns the prediction of response. There is little doubt that exercise training response is influenced by a multitude of determinants. Moreover, indications of interaction between influencing factors of training efficacy lead to the hypothesis that optimal predictive accuracy may be attained using an interactive rather than additive approach. Taken together, aiming at conclusive inference and optimal predictive accuracy in the investigation of subject-by-training interaction entails specific requirements that are deducibly based on statistical principles but beset with many practical difficulties. Therefore, pragmatic alternatives are warranted.},

We give the approximate sampling distribution of the log response ratio, discuss why it is a particularly useful metric for many applications in ecology, and demonstrate how to use it in meta-analysis. The meta-analysis of response-ratio data is illustrated using experimental data on the effects of increased atmospheric CO2 on plant biomass responses.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to compare changes in muscle size, strength, and power between free-weight and machine-based exercises. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The online databases of Pubmed, Scopus, and Web of Science were each searched using the following terms: "free weights" OR barbells OR dumbbells AND machines" up until September 15, 2020. A three-level random effects meta-analytic model was used to compute effect sizes. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: When strength was tested using a free-weight exercise, individuals training with free-weights gained more strength than those training with machines (ES: 0.655; [95\% CI: 0.269, 1.041]). When strength was tested a machine-based exercise incorporated as part of the machine-based training program, individuals training with machines gained more strength than those training with free-weights (ES: -0.784 [95\% CI: -1.223, -0.344]). When strength was tested using a neutral device, machines and free-weight exercises resulted in similar strength gains (ES: 0.128 [95\% CI: -0303, 0.559]). There were no differences in the change in power (ES: -0.049 [95\% CI: -0.557, 0.460]) or muscle hypertrophy (ES: -0.01 [95\% CI: -0.525, 0.545]) between exercise modes. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals looking to increase strength and power should consider the specificity of exercise, and how their strength and power will be tested and applied. Individuals looking to increase general strength and muscle mass to maintain health may choose whichever activity they prefer and are more likely to adhere to.},

  abstract = {The standard fitness-fatigue model (FFM) was developed more than 40 years ago and remains a prominent conceptual model within exercise science. Translation from a conceptual form into a mathematical structure reveals a collection of models (FFMs) with common properties linking training inputs to performance outcomes. The greatest potential use of FFMs is to predict future performance of athletes with sufficient accuracy to assist with training program design and planning key tapering periods. However, despite a long history and consistent study, there has been limited uptake in practice. This is most likely due to a lack of accessible resources explaining key concepts and processes required to fit models, and uncertainty regarding overall predictive validity. Part I of this review series provides a comprehensive overview of FFMs and discusses three key aspects of fitting models including: 1) training load quantification; 2) criterion performance selection; and 3) parameter estimation. As the majority of athletes engage in sports where performance is complex and determined by a range of physical, psychological and technical factors, it is argued that FFMs may be best placed to quantify components of fitness (e.g., strength, power) targeted by an athlete's training, rather than competitive outcomes. Additionally, contemporary approaches to training monitoring (e.g., measurement of barbell velocity and repetitions in reserve) are recommended as tools to generate high frequency ``performance'' measures to better fit FFMs. Essential further developments require collaboration between researchers and practitioners with larger data sets to establish conditions where accurate predictions to future training could be obtained. A set of code-based resources in the R programming language are included with the review series to assist in fitting and evaluating models, and to enhance understanding of concepts described.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To facilitate the Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization/United Nations University Joint (FAO/WHO/UNU) Expert Consultation on Energy and Protein Requirements which met in Rome in 1981, Schofield et al. reviewed the literature and produced predictive equations for both sexes for the following ages: 0-3, 3-10, 10-18, 18-30, 30-60 and {$>$}60 years. These formed the basis for the equations used in 1985 FAO/WHO/UNU document, Energy and Protein Requirements. While Schofield's analysis has served a significant role in re-establishing the importance of using basal metabolic rate (BMR) to predict human energy requirements, recent workers have subsequently queried the universal validity and application of these equations. A survey of the most recent studies (1980-2000) in BMR suggests that in most cases the current FAO/WHO/UNU predictive equations overestimate BMR in many communities. The FAO/WHO/UNU equations to predict BMR were developed using a database that contained a disproportionate number--3388 out of 7173 (47\%)--of Italian subjects. The Schofield database contained relatively few subjects from the tropical region. The objective here is to review the historical development in the measurement and application of BMR and to critically review the Schofield et al. BMR database presenting a series of new equations to predict BMR. DESIGN: This division, while arbitrary, will enable readers who wish to omit the historical review of BMR to concentrate on the evolution of the new BMR equations. SETTING: BMR data collected from published and measured values. SUBJECTS: A series of new equations (Oxford equations) have been developed using a data set of 10,552 BMR values that (1) excluded all the Italian subjects and (2) included a much larger number (4018) of people from the tropics. RESULTS: In general, the Oxford equations tend to produce lower BMR values than the current FAO/WHO/UNU equations in 18-30 and 30-60 year old males and in all females over 18 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: This is an opportune moment to re-examine the role and place of BMR measurements in estimating total energy requirements today. The Oxford equations' future use and application will surely depend on their ability to predict more accurately the BMR in contemporary populations.},

J Strength Cond Res 37(8): e470--e484, 2023---Intentionally slow-velocity resistance exercise (ISVRE) is suggested by some to be equally or more effective than fast or traditional velocities for increasing muscular strength. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the effect ISVRE has on strength adaptations compared with faster or traditional velocities, with subgroup analyses exploring age, sex, and training status as confounding factors on the influence of velocity on strength adaptation. Eligible studies (n = 24) were required to be chronic (multiple weeks) randomized or nonrandomized comparative studies using dynamic constant external resistance for training and testing, and pre-post strength assessments. All studies examined healthy individuals (n = 625; fast or traditional n = 306, intentionally slow n = 319). A random-effects meta-analysis indicated a significant (p {$\leq$} 0.05) effect in favor of fast training (effect size [ES] = 0.21, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.02--0.41, p = 0.03). Publication bias was noted through trim and fill analysis, with an adjusted effect size estimate of 0.32 (p {$<$} 0.001). Subgroup analyses indicated no difference between trained and untrained subjects (QM = 0.01, p = 0.93), and no difference between older and younger subgroups (QM = 0.09, p = 0.77), despite younger favoring faster (ES = 0.23, p = 0.049) and older not favoring either velocity (ES = 0.16, p = 0.46). Subgroup analysis also indicated women favored faster training (ES = 0.95, p {$<$} 0.001) in comparison to men (ES = 0.08, p = 0.58). Contrary to some previous reviews, these results indicate that chronic fast or traditional velocity resistance exercise increases muscular strength to a greater degree than ISVRE training. Resistance training velocity must be considered if strength is a desired outcome.},

In assessing the accuracy of the current equation by comparison to AMA measured by computerized axial tomography, error in each of the four approximations made was found to result in a 20 to 25\% overestimate of AMA. Two correctible error sources were: a 10 to 15\% overestimation caused by assuming a circular midarm muscle compartment and a 5 to 10\% overestimation due to inclusion of midarm cross-sectional bone area. Corrected AMA equations for men and women were respectively: [(MAC - pi x TSF)2/4 pi] - 10, and [MAC - pi x TSF)2/4 pip] - 6.5. With two additional study groups, the overall improved accuracy of the new equations was confirmed, although the average error for a given patient was 7 to 8\%; the relationship between corrected AMA and total body muscle mass was established [muscle mass (kg) = (ht, cm2) (0.0264 + 0.0029 x corrected AMA)]; and the minimal range of corrected AMA values compatible with survival (9 to 11 cm2) was defined. Bedside estimates of undernutrition severity and prognosis can therefore be calculated from two simple measurements, TSF and MAC.},

This book, the result of cooperation between the Center for Dewey Studies at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, and the Dewey Center at the University of Cologne, provides an excellent example of the international character of pragmatist studies against the backdrop of constructivist concerns. As a part of their exploration of the many points of contact between classical pragmatism and contemporary constructivism, its contributors turn their attention to theories of interaction and transaction, communication and culture, learning and education, community and democracy, theory and practice, and inquiry and methods. Part One is a basic survey of Dewey's pragmatism and its implications for contemporary constructivism. Part Two examines the implications of the connections between Deweyan pragmatism and contemporary constructivism. Part Three presents a lively exchange among the contributors, as they challenge one another and defend their positions and perspectives. As they seek common ground, they articulate concepts such as power, truth, relativism, inquiry, and democracy from pragmatist and interactive constructivist vantage points in ways that are designed to render the preceding essays even more accessible. This concluding discussion demonstrates both the enduring relevance of classical pragmatism and the challenge of its reconstruction from the perspective of the Cologne program of interactive constructivism.},

Here we show that a method based on the quantitative analysis of natural language published over the past 200 years captures reliable patterns in historical subjective wellbeing. Using sentiment analysis on the basis of psychological valence norms, we compute a national valence index for the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany and Italy, indicating relative happiness in response to national and international wars and in comparison to historical trends in longevity and gross domestic product. We validate our method using Eurobarometer survey data from the 1970s and demonstrate robustness using words with stable historical meanings, diverse corpora (newspapers, magazines and books) and additional word norms.

  abstract = {Concreteness---the psycholinguistic property of referring to a perceptible entity---enhances processing speed, comprehension, and memory. These represent selective filters for cognition likely to influence language evolution in competitive language environments. Taking a culturomics approach, we use multiple language corpora representing more than 350 billion words combined with concreteness norms for over 40,000 English words and demonstrate a systematic rise in concrete language in American English over the last 200years, both within and across word classes (nouns, verbs, and prepositions). Comparisons between new and old concreteness norms indicate this is not explained by semantic bleaching, but we find some evidence that the rise is related to changes in population demographics and may be associated with increasing numbers of second language learners or attention economics in response to crowding in the language market. We also examine the influence of gender and literacy. In sum, we demonstrate evolution in the psycholinguistic structure of American English, with a well-established impact on cognitive processing, which is likely to permeate modern language use.},

A higher prevalence of bulimia nervosa and greater cravings for sweets have also been reported in these patients. The present study aimed to compare meal-related appetite and secretion of the 'satiety peptide' cholecystokinin (CCK) and glucose regulatory hormones in PCOS women and controls. Sixteen pairs of women with PCOS and controls matched for age and body mass index participated in the study. After an overnight fast, blood samples were collected during ingestion of a standardized meal. We determined basal and postprandial blood levels of CCK, insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, cortisol, growth hormone and glucose. Self-ratings of appetite were assessed by a visual analog scale. PCOS women had a significantly lower meal-related CCK response (p {$<$} 0.05) with no association with satiety, as in the controls (r = 0.64). There was a tendency to higher ratings of craving for sweets in PCOS women (p = 0.07) but no correlation with insulin, as in the controls (r = 0.50). Within the PCOS group, ratings of craving for sweets were inversely related to testosterone (r = - 0.60) and the CCK response was positively correlated with levels of free testosterone (r = 0.50). We conclude that women with PCOS have reduced postprandial CCK secretion and deranged appetite regulation associated with increased levels of testosterone. Impaired CCK secretion may play a role in the greater frequency of binge eating and overweight in women with PCOS.},

Eleven men volunteered for this study (21.7 \textpm{} 5.1 years; height: 178.5 \textpm{} 6.4 cm; body mass: 79.8 \textpm{} 10.3 kg). Subjects were randomly assigned to either a supplement (BET) or placebo (PL) group. Supplementation occurred for 15 days. Subjects reported to the Human Performance Laboratory on 5 occasions during this period, separated by 72 hours, for a testing and exercise session on an isokinetic chest press device. After each exercise protocol, subjects rated their fatigue and muscle soreness on a 15-cm visual analog scale. Subjects then consumed no daily BET for 4 weeks but maintained familiarity with the exercise device once per week. After the washout period, subjects resumed the BET protocol using the opposite drink and repeated the same 15-day protocol. No differences were noted in maximum CON force output between pre (335.9 \textpm{} 78.3 and 321.6 \textpm{} 63.6 N) and post (330.3 \textpm{} 74.8 and 330.2 \textpm{} 71.6 N) workouts in both BET and PL, respectively. In addition, no differences were noted in maximum ECC force output between pre (352.0 \textpm{} 90.6 and 324.4 \textpm{} 85.2 N) and post (353.2 \textpm{} 98.2 and 366.9 \textpm{} 128.5 N) workouts in BET and PL, respectively. No differences in subjective measures of soreness and fatigue were seen, but a significant reduction in {$\Delta$} fatigue was observed in BET compared to PL. In conclusion, 15 days of betaine supplementation did not increase peak CON or ECC force outputs during an isokinetic chest press but did appear to reduce subjective measures of fatigue to the exercise protocol.},

  abstract = {Data exploration has enormous potential to modify and create hypotheses, models, and theories. Harnessing the potential of transparent exploration replaces the common, flawed purpose of intransparent exploration: to produce results that appear to confirm a claim by hiding steps of an analysis. For transparent exploration to succeed, however, methodological guidance, elaboration and implementation in the publication system is required. We present some basic conceptions to stimulate further development. In this first of two parts, we describe the current blending of confirmatory and exploratory research and propose how to separate the two via severe testing. A claim is confirmed if it passes a test that probably would have failed if the claim was false. Such a severe test makes a risky prediction. It adheres to an evidential norm with a threshold, usually p \&lt; {$\alpha$} = .05, but other norms are possible, for example, with Bayesian approaches. To this end, adherence requires control against questionable research practices like p-hacking and HARKing. At present, preregistration seems to be the most feasible mode of control. Analyses that do not adhere to a norm or where this cannot be controlled should be considered as exploratory. We propose that exploration serves to modify or create new claims that are likely to pass severe testing with new data. Confirmation and exploration, if sound and transparent, benefit from one another. The second part will provide suggestions for planning and conducting exploration and for implementing more transparent exploratory research.},

  abstract = {Transparent exploration in science invites novel discoveries by stimulating new or modified claims about hypotheses, models, and theories. In this second article of two consecutive parts, we outline how to explore data patterns that inform such claims. Transparent exploration should be guided by two contrasting goals: comprehensiveness and efficiency. Comprehensivenes calls for a thorough search across all variables and possible analyses as to not to miss anything that might be hidden in the data. Efficiency adds that new and modified claims should withstand severe testing with new data and give rise to relevant new knowledge. Efficiency aims to reduce false positive claims, which is better achieved if a bunch of results is reduced into a few claims. Means for increasing efficiency are methods for filtering local data patterns (e.g., only interpreting associations that pass statistical tests or using cross-validation) and for smoothing global data patterns (e.g., reducing associations to relations between a few latent variables). We suggest that researchers should condense their results with filtering and smoothing before publication. Coming up with just a few most promising claims saves resources for confirmation trials and keeps scientific communication lean. This should foster the acceptance of transparent exploration. We end with recommendations derived from the considerations in both parts: an exploratory research agenda and suggestions for stakeholders such as journal editors on how to implement more valuable exploration. These include special journal sections or entire journals dedicated to explorative research and a mandatory separate listing of the confirmed and new claims in a paper's abstract.},

Towards this end we make two contributions. The first is a schema for thinking about research activities along two dimensions---the extent to which work is explanatory, focusing on identifying and estimating causal effects, and the degree of consideration given to testing predictions of outcomes---and how these two priorities can complement, rather than compete with, one another. Our second contribution is to advocate that computational social scientists devote more attention to combining prediction and explanation, which we call integrative modelling, and to outline some practical suggestions for realizing this goal.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a multifaceted endocrine-metabolic condition affecting around 5-15\% of women globally. Despite its prevalence and diverse impact, the psychological aspect of PCOS is often underestimated in clinical settings, leading to significant distress among affected individuals. This study aimed to explore the extent of body image perception disorders, psychological comorbidities, and their influence on the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in women with PCOS. Additionally, we focused on measuring the impact of factors associated with PCOS, particularly obesity, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their effects. METHODS: An online survey was distributed anonymously to gynecologists, hospitals, and women's clinics across Austria, Germany, and Switzerland, as well as through social media platforms to connect with women with PCOS. The survey was conducted from November 14, 2023, to February 05, 2024. HRQOL, anxiety/depression levels, body image and self-esteem were assessed employing the Modified-PCOS-Questionnaire (MPCOSQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Multidimensional Body-Self Relations Questionnaire Appearance Scales (MBSRQ-AS) and Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSE) respectively. Identification of potential confounding variables relied on their plausibility and association with the estimate. Adjusted odds ratios and their respective 95\% confidence intervals were computed through regression analysis. RESULTS: 587 participants fully completed the questionnaire. The study participants were on average 32.5\,\textpm\,5.9~years old and had a BMI of 31.3\,\textpm\,7.8~kg/m2. In this study, 84.5\% of all PCOS patients exhibited pathological scores in the MBSRQ-AS Appearance Evaluation, 83.8\% in Body Areas Satisfaction, and 67.5\% in Overweight Preoccupation. Half of the participants (46.7\%) showed significantly poor results in the RSE, indicating low self-esteem. A notable portion of the study participants displayed elevated HADS scores, which supports a higher rate of distress in PCOS patients. (HADS-Anxiety\,{$>$}\,8: 75.0\% (440); HADS-Depression\,{$>$}\,8: 57.6\% (338). Examining the HRQOL of PCOS patients revealed that all average scores of the subscales, except for the Acne subscale and MPCOSQ-Total (3.6\,\textpm\,1:0), were situated in the lower half, indicating diminished HRQOL. The linear regression revealed that pathological values in the MBSRQ-AS, indicating impaired body image, were associated with low scores in the MPCOSQ subscales and HADS scales, suggesting impaired HRQOL and a higher rate of distress in PCOS patients. Furthermore, the multivariate analysis showed a statistically significant link between adverse body perception and HRQOL, as well as distress among PCOS patients in this study group. [multivariate HADS-Anxiety: MBSRQ-AS Body Areas Satisfaction (B: - 2.10; CI: - 3.88; - 0.33; p\,=\,0.02) HADS-Depression MBSRQ-AS Body Areas Satisfaction (B: - 1.92; CI: - 3.59; - 0.26; p\,=\,0.02)]. CONCLUSION: Our findings reveal that obesity and a negative body image are interconnected factors that adversely affect both HRQOL and mental health in women with PCOS. Healthcare professionals should recognize the negative effects of obesity and poor body image in patients with PCOS and proactively provide effective treatment options.},

We argue that the increasingly computational nature of social science is beginning to reverse this traditional bias against prediction; however, it has also highlighted three important issues that require resolution. First, current practices for evaluating predictions must be better standardized. Second, theoretical limits to predictive accuracy in complex social systems must be better characterized, thereby setting expectations for what can be predicted or explained. Third, predictive accuracy and interpretability must be recognized as complements, not substitutes, when evaluating explanations. Resolving these three issues will lead to better, more replicable, and more useful social science.}

Can self, soul, consciousness, "I" arise out of mere matter? If it cannot, then how can you or I be here? I Am a Strange Loop argues that the key to understanding selves and consciousness is the "strange loop"-a special kind of abstract feedback loop inhabiting our brains. The most central and complex symbol in your brain is the one called "I." The "I" is the nexus in our brain, one of many symbols seeming to have free will and to have gained the paradoxical ability to push particles around, rather than the reverse. How can a mysterious abstraction be real-or is our "I" merely a convenient fiction? Does an "I" exert genuine power over the particles in our brain, or is it helplessly pushed around by the laws of physics? These are the mysteries tackled in I Am a Strange Loop, Douglas Hofstadter's first book-length journey into philosophy since G\"odel, Escher, Bach.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to compare perceptual (RPE and pain), cardiac (heart rate), lactate, and endocrine (cortisol) responses with concentric (CON) and eccentric (ECC) resistance exercise protocols using the same absolute workload. METHODS: Eight healthy men with resistance-training experience participated in the study. Subjects completed two experimental trials consisting of either CON contractions or ECC contractions at the same absolute workload for each of four exercises: bench press, leg extension, military press, and leg curl. Subjects performed four sets of 12 repetitions at 80\% of 10-RM with 90-s rest periods. Blood samples were taken before, immediately after, and 15-min postexercise. RESULTS: There was a significant trial effect for RPE, with CON exercise eliciting a higher RPE than ECC exercise (6.71 +/- 0.51 and 4.10 +/- 0.27, respectively). A significant trial effect was also demonstrated for pain, with CON exercise producing a higher pain rating than ECC exercise (5.59 +/- 0.41 and 3.23 +/- 0.27, respectively). Significantly higher heart rates and lactates were also demonstrated during the CON trial. For cortisol, a significant interaction was revealed between the pre- and immediate posttrial measures but not an overall trial effect. Correlational analyses revealed a significant relationship between RPE and pain for both trials. CONCLUSIONS: CON exercise elicits greater perceptual (higher RPE and pain rating), cardiac, lactate and cortisol response than ECC exercise at the same absolute workload. Data demonstrate that relative to absolute load, RPE and pain respond to resistance exercise in a similar fashion. Additionally, physiological cues are consistent with these perceptual data.},

Insulin sensitivity (euglycemic insulin clamp), insulin secretion and glucose tolerance (iv glucose tolerance test), basal sex steroid hormones, gonadotropins and free fatty acids (FFA), skin folds and waist hip ratio (WHR) were evaluated before (PCO-BD) and after (PCO-AD) diet-induced weight reduction to a weight stable level [mean (SD) diet duration 14.9 (6.2) months]. Mean weight loss was 12.4 kg (4.7; P {$<$} 0.0001), equalling a reduction from a body mass index (BMI) of 32.2 (3.7) kg/m2 to 27.6 (3.7; P {$<$} 0.0001) kg/m2. The results were compared with those of two groups of weight stable (no diet) women, 21 with PCOS (PCO-ND) and 23 normal control subjects (C), who were matched to the BMI the diet group reached after weight loss. Insulin sensitivity index (M/I) improved on average 132\% (P {$<$} 0.001) and plasma FFA by 32\% (P {$<$} 0.01), serum sex hormone binding globulin levels increased by 35\% (P {$<$} 0.01), and the sum of truncal-abdominal skin-folds (subscapular, umbilical, and suprailiacal) were reduced by 28\% (P {$<$} 0.0001), whereas the early insulin response to iv glucose, the levels of gonadotropins and androstenedione, and the femoral sc fat did not change significantly with weight loss. M/I, levels of SHBG and FFA and truncal-abdominal fat reached levels similar to the controls, whereas PCO-ND had lower M/I (P {$<$} 0.01) and SHBG levels (P {$<$} 0.0001), greater concentrations of FFA (P {$<$} 0.01) and truncal-abdominal fat (P {$<$} 0.05) than C. Among women with normal glucose tolerance, the insulin increment was higher in both PCO-AD (P {$<$} 0.05) and PCO-ND (P {$<$} 0.01) than in C. There was a strong correlation between M/I and sum of truncal-abdominal skinfolds in all groups (PCO-BD: r = 0.82; P {$<$} 0.001, PCO-AD: r = 0.68; P {$<$} 0.05, PCO-ND: r = 0.81; P {$<$} 0.0001, C: r = 0.44; P {$<$} 0.05). The variation in M/I in PCO-AD and PCO-ND (pooled) was best explained by FFA and truncal-adbominal fat (model R2 = 0.67). In conclusion, insulin resistance in obese women with PCOS was reduced by weight loss to similar levels as BMI-matched control subjects, suggesting that insulin resistance in PCOS is not a feature of PCOS per se.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

  abstract = {Bayesian statistical approaches to mixed treatment comparisons (MTCs) are becoming more popular because of their flexibility and interpretability. Many randomized clinical trials report multiple outcomes with possible inherent correlations. Moreover, MTC data are typically sparse (although richer than standard meta-analysis, comparing only two treatments), and researchers often choose study arms based upon which treatments emerge as superior in previous trials. In this paper, we summarize existing hierarchical Bayesian methods for MTCs with a single outcome and introduce novel Bayesian approaches for multiple outcomes simultaneously, rather than in separate MTC analyses. We do this by incorporating partially observed data and its correlation structure between outcomes through contrast-based and arm-based parameterizations that consider any unobserved treatment arms as missing data to be imputed. We also extend the model to apply to all types of generalized linear model outcomes, such as count or continuous responses. We offer a simulation study under various missingness mechanisms (e.g., missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random) providing evidence that our models outperform existing models in terms of bias, mean squared error, and coverage probability then illustrate our methods with a real MTC dataset. We close with a discussion of our results, several contentious issues in MTC analysis, and a few avenues for future methodological development. Copyright \copyright{} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {Reliability refers to the reproducibility of values of a test, assay or other measurement in repeated trials on the same individuals. Better reliability implies better precision of single measurements and better tracking of changes in measurements in research or practical settings. The main measures of reliability are within-subject random variation, systematic change in the mean, and retest correlation. A simple, adaptable form of within-subject variation is the typical (standard) error of measurement: the standard deviation of an individual's repeated measurements. For many measurements in sports medicine and science, the typical error is best expressed as a coefficient of variation (percentage of the mean). A biased, more limited form of within-subject variation is the limits of agreement: the 95\% likely range of change of an individual's measurements between 2 trials. Systematic changes in the mean of a measure between consecutive trials represent such effects as learning, motivation or fatigue; these changes need to be eliminated from estimates of within-subject variation. Retest correlation is difficult to interpret, mainly because its value is sensitive to the heterogeneity of the sample of participants. Uses of reliability include decision-making when monitoring individuals, comparison of tests or equipment, estimation of sample size in experiments and estimation of the magnitude of individual differences in the response to a treatment. Reasonable precision for estimates of reliability requires approximately 50 study participants and at least 3 trials. Studies aimed at assessing variation in reliability between tests or equipment require complex designs and analyses that researchers seldom perform correctly. A wider understanding of reliability and adoption of the typical error as the standard measure of reliability would improve the assessment of tests and equipment in our disciplines.},

In this meta-analytic review we identify the most reliable measures of power and the factors affecting reliability. Our measures of reliability were the typical (standard) error of measurement expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV) and the percent change in the mean between trials. We meta-analysed these measures for power or work from 101 studies of healthy adults. Measures and tests with the smallest CV in exercise of a given duration include field tests of sprint running (approximately 0.9\%), peak power in an incremental test on a treadmill or cycle ergometer (approximately 0.9\%), equivalent mean power in a constant-power test lasting 1 minute to 3 hours on a treadmill or cycle ergometer (0.9 to 2.0\%), lactate-threshold power (approximately 1.5\%), and jump height or distance (approximately 2.0\%). The CV for mean power on isokinetic ergometers was relatively large ({$>$} 4\%). CV were larger for nonathletes versus athletes (1.3 x), female versus male nonathletes (1.4 x), shorter (approximately 1-second) and longer (approximately 1-hour) versus 1-minute tests ({$<$} or = 1.6 x), and respiratory- versus ergometer-based measures of power (1.4 to 1.6 x). There was no clear-cut effect of time between trials. The importance of a practice trial was evident in studies with {$>$} 2 trials: the CV between the first 2 trials was 1.3 times the CV between subsequent trials; performance also improved by 1.2\% between the first 2 trials but by only 0.2\% between subsequent trials. These findings should help exercise practitioners and researchers select or design good measures and protocols for tests of physical performance.},

Multiple regression analyses were used to derive equations for predicting quadriceps, hamstrings, and total thigh muscle CSA of the dominant limb from the anthropometric dimensions on a random sample of 30 of the subjects. Cross-validation (CV) analyses were performed for each equation on: (a) the nondominant thigh of the derivation group (N = 30); (b) the dominant thigh of the CV group (N = 13); and (c) the nondominant thigh of the CV group (N = 13). The CV total error values for the quadriceps, hamstrings, and total thigh muscle CSA ranged from 5.4 to 14.4, 3.3 to 5.5, and 10.0 to 25.4 cm2, respectively. The anthropometric equations are recommended for one-time estimates of muscle CSA values in healthy, well-nourished young adult males when more sophisticated procedures are not available.},

Doing so will ensure contributions to the field are conducted as rigorously as possible. Nonetheless, concerns have emerged regarding the ability to truly isolate the impact of exercise training, and the nature of individual responses in relation to mean group changes. The purpose of this review is threefold. First, the strengths and limitations associated with current methods for quantifying the contribution of exercise to observed treatment response heterogeneity will be discussed. Second, current methods used to categorize participants based on their response to exercise will be outlined, as well as proposed mechanisms for factors that contribute to response variation.

Little empirical efforts have been made to determine how psychological factors influence changes in RPE. This study examined the influence of self-efficacy expectations on changes in RPE as a function of exercise intensity.         METHODS~         Participants were 193 sedentary older adults (mean age = 66.7 years) who completed an assessment of exercise self-efficacy and aerobic capacity.         RESULTS~         Analyses indicated that RPE during exercise changed in both a linear and a quadratic manner as intensity increased and that self-efficacy was a predictor of both patterns of change. Those high in self-efficacy maintained a constant rate of change in RPE as exercise intensity increased, whereas less efficacious participants exhibited a slower rate of change in RPE as a function of exercise intensity, with an initial gradual curve at lower intensity and a more dramatic trajectory at higher intensity.         CONCLUSIONS~         Results have important implications for using RPE for exercise prescription in older adults and suggest that exercise self-efficacy is implicated in patterns of RPE change.},

Innate behavior and its relation to the termination of needs are basic facts, as are also such physiological events as sensory after-discharge and internal oscillatory, variable factors. The development of the theory offers an account of behavior in terms of reinforcement, generalization, motivation, inhibition, oscillation, and response evocation which may be thought of as a chain of conditions beginning with the physical stimulus and ending in the response. 13 major symbolic constructs, directly or indirectly anchored to 6 objectively observable events, are utilized in explanation of the above chain of conditions of behavior. An examination of stimulus compounds and patterns leads the author, in opposition to Gestalt psychology, to the view that patterning is a secondary rather than a primary principle of behavior. The 22 chapters of the book contain lists of references, technical notes, and derivations of formulae. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups: High-efficacy (HE), low-efficacy (LE), or control. Efficacy expectations were manipulated via false performance feedback. During the task participants provided differentiated ratings of perceived effort at 15-s intervals. Effort tolerance was determined by the length of time the participant could maintain the task. Repeated measures (RM) multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) indicated the HE group found the task less strenuous and more enjoyable than the LE or control group. Furthermore, the HE group demonstrated greater tolerance of the task than either the LE or control group.

Ninety-two healthy participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups; performing strength training one- (EX1), two- (EX2), or three- (EX3) times-per-week and a non-training control (CON) group. Whole-body strength training was performed using 2-5 sets and 4-12 repetitions per exercise and 7-9 exercises per session. All training groups attended supervised resistance training for 6 months. Body composition was measured by dual X-ray absorptiometry and fasting blood samples were taken pre- and post-training. There were significant main effects of time for total fat mass (F = 28.12, P {$<$} 0.001) and abdominal fat mass (F = 20.72, P {$<$} 0.001). Pre- to post-study, statistically significant reductions in fat mass ({$\Delta$} = -1.3 \textpm{} 1.4 kg, P {$<$} 0.001, n = 26) were observed in EX3. Pre- to post-study reductions in low density lipoprotein (LDL) concentration ({$\Delta$} = -0.38 \textpm{} 0.44 mmol{$\cdot$}L-1, P = 0.003, n = 19) were observed only in EX3, whereas a significant pre- to post-study increases in high density lipoprotein (HDL) concentration (0.14-0.19 mmol{$\cdot$}L-1) were observed in all training groups. Most variables at baseline demonstrated a significant (negative) relationship when correlating baseline values with their change during the study including: Interleukin-6 (IL-6) (r = -0.583, P {$<$} 0.001), high-sensitivity c-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (r = -0.471, P {$<$} 0.001, and systolic blood pressure (r = -0.402, P = 0.003). The present study suggests that having more than two resistance training sessions in a week could be of benefit in the management of body composition and lipid profile. Nevertheless, interestingly, and importantly, those individuals with a higher baseline in systolic blood pressure, IL-6 and hs-CRP derived greatest benefit from the resistance training intervention, regardless of how many times-a-week they trained. Finally, the present study found no evidence that higher training frequency would induce greater benefit regarding inflammation markers or glycemic profile in healthy older adults.},

Here, we suggest that the opposite is also true and review extensive evidence that effort can also add value. Not only can the same outcomes be more rewarding if we apply more (not less) effort, sometimes we select options precisely because they require effort. Given the increasing recognition of effort's role in motivation, cognitive control, and value-based decision-making, considering this neglected side of effort will not only improve formal computational models, but also provide clues about how to promote sustained mental effort across time.},

The position from which we see the world around us impacts our research interests, how we approach the research and participants, the questions we ask, and how we interpret the data. In this article, we argue that it is not a straightforward or easy task to conceptualize and practice positionality. We have developed a Social Identity Map that researchers can use to explicitly identify and reflect on their social identity to address the difficulty that many novice critical qualitative researchers experience when trying to conceptualize their social identities and positionality. The Social Identity Map is not meant to be used as a rigid tool but rather as a flexible starting point to guide researchers to reflect and be reflexive about their social location. The map involves three tiers: the identification of social identities (Tier 1), how these positions impact our life (Tier 2), and details that may be tied to the particularities of our social identity (Tier 3). With the use of this map as a guide, we aim for researchers to be able to better identify and understand their social locations and how they may pose challenges and aspects of ease within the qualitative research process. Being explicit about our social identities allows us (as researchers) to produce reflexive research and give our readers the tools to recognize how we produced the data. Being reflexive about our social identities, particularly in comparison to the social position of our participants, helps us better understand the power relations imbued in our research, further providing an opportunity to be reflexive about how to address this in a responsible and respectful way.},

  abstract = {Reflexivity is the act of examining one's own assumption, belief, and judgement systems, and thinking carefully and critically about how these influence the research process. The practice of reflexivity confronts and questions who we are as researchers and how this guides our work. It is central in debates on objectivity, subjectivity, and the very foundations of social science research and generated knowledge. Incorporating reflexivity in the research process is traditionally recognized as one of the most notable differences between qualitative and quantitative methodologies. Qualitative research centres and celebrates the participants' personal and unique lived experience. Therefore, qualitative researchers are readily encouraged to consider how their own unique positionalities inform the research process and this forms an important part of training within this paradigm. Quantitative methodologies in social and personality psychology, and more generally, on the other hand, have remained seemingly detached from this level of reflexivity and general reflective practice. In this commentary, we, three quantitative researchers who have grappled with the compatibility of reflexivity within our own research, argue that reflexivity has much to offer quantitative methodologists. The act of reflexivity prompts researchers to acknowledge and centre their own positionalities, encourages a more thoughtful engagement with every step of the research process, and thus, as we argue, contributes to the ongoing reappraisal of openness and transparency in psychology. In this paper, we make the case for integrating reflexivity across all research approaches, before providing a `beginner's guide' for quantitative researchers wishing to engage reflexively with their own work, providing concrete recommendations, worked examples, and reflexive prompts.},

This study aimed to report the prevalence of binge eating and food cravings and their relation to obesity risk in women with PCOS. Participants completed an online survey including the Bulimia Investigatory Test, Edinburgh, Food Cravings-Trait Questionnaire and the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire revised-18. The study included obese (n~=~340), overweight (n~=~70) and lean (n~=~45) women with PCOS and lean healthy women (n~=~40). Sixty percent of obese women with PCOS were categorised with binge-eating behaviour, with 39\% presenting with clinically significant behaviour. Obese women with PCOS presented with high mean food cravings-trait scores (131.6~\textpm ~28.9) that were significantly greater compared with lean (114.0~\textpm ~34.9) and overweight women with PCOS (120.1~\textpm ~29.5; p~{$<~$}0.001). Multiple regression exploring relations between eating styles and adiposity explained 57\% of the variance in binge eating symptom scores in women with PCOS (F~=~130.4; p~{$<~$}0.001, n~=~463): significant predictors were food cravings total score (beta~=~0.53; p~{$<~$}0.001), emotional eating score (beta~=~0.18; p~{$<~$}0.001), body mass index (beta~=~0.11; p~{$<~$}0.001) and uncontrolled eating score (beta~=~0.009; p~=~0.02). Compared with lean healthy women, lean women with PCOS exhibited significantly higher binge eating symptom scores (10.9~\textpm ~7.8 versus 7.4~\textpm ~6.0; p~{$<~$}0.05), though similar total food craving scores (114.0~\textpm ~34.9 versus 105.6~\textpm ~26.6: NS). This study is the largest, to date, to robustly report that a high proportion of women with PCOS exhibit binge eating behaviours. We recommend screening women with PCOS for binge eating behaviours to help inform the choice of weight management approach for this clinical population.},

PCOS is the primary cause of anovulatory infertility, with major health and economic costs, yet we are unaware of any community-based, natural history studies on fertility and fertility treatments published to date. We aim to compare infertility, fertility treatment use, and relationship to body mass index (BMI) in women reporting PCOS to women not reporting PCOS in a community-based population. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional analysis of a longitudinal cohort study, the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (ALSWH). For the ALSWH, women from the general community were randomly selected from the national public insurance database. Mailed survey data were collected at multiple time points. At survey 4, there were 9145 respondents aged 28-33 years. Of 8612 women with known PCOS status, 478 women reported having PCOS. Information regarding fertility status was available for 4856 women. This was the subgroup used in this analysis. The main outcomes measures are self-reported PCOS status, BMI, infertility, and use of fertility therapies including ovulation induction and in vitro fertilization (IVF). Logistic regression was used to examine factors associated with infertility and use of fertility treatment. RESULTS: Self-reported PCOS prevalence was 5.8\% (95\% confidence interval [CI]: 5.3\%-6.4\%). Infertility was noted by 72\% of 309 women reporting PCOS, compared with 16\% of 4547 women not reporting PCOS (p{$<$}0.001). Infertility was 15-fold higher in women reporting PCOS (adjusted odds ratio 14.9, 95\% CI 10.9-20.3), independent of BMI. Of women reporting infertility, there was greater use of fertility hormone treatment, (62\%, n=116 vs. 33\%, n=162, p{$<$}0.001) in women reporting PCOS; however, IVF use was similar. CONCLUSIONS: In this community-based cohort of women, infertility and use of fertility hormone treatment was significantly higher in women reporting PCOS. Considering the prevalence of PCOS and the health and economic burden of infertility, strategies to optimize fertility are important.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resistance training holds promise for nursing home residents to prevent further disabilities, falls, and fractures. Free weight as well as machine training may offer an efficient option to improve physical performance, but the feasibility of these training regimes among elderly who require continuous institutional care is still open. AIMS: (1) To examine the feasibility of a 3-month machine vs. free weight strength training program in institutionalized older adults, and (2) to determine the effects on physical performance. METHODS: This study is a two-arm, single-blind, randomized controlled feasibility study within a nursing home. 45 institutionalized elderly men and women (aged 83.8\,\textpm\,8.0, 12 men, 33 women) were randomly divided into two groups. The two groups completed either a free weight (FWT) or machine training (MT) for 12~weeks, twice per week, 45-60~min per session, in an individually supervised format. Performance was assessed with the 11-step stair-climbing test, 10-m walk test, Timed Up and Go Test (TUG), 30-s Chair Rising Test (CRT), grip strength, body mass index. RESULTS: Indices of feasibility showed a recruitment and adherence rate of 53.6 and 87.5\%, respectively. 35.6\% of the participants dropped out after several weeks for personal reasons, illness, medical visits, or hospital stays. After the program no significant differences on motor performance were found between MT and FWT. However, there were significant improvements for both training groups on the TUG and the CRT. CONCLUSIONS: The present pilot study showed that it is feasible to conduct a strength training program in institutionalized participants. The more robust changes in motor function could serve as a basis for large randomized clinical trials.},

This paper argues that Betz's defence is unsuccessful. First, Betz's argument is sketched, and it is shown that the IPCC does not avoid the need to ``translate'' claims. In Section~2, it is argued that Betz mischaracterises the force of the methodological critique. Section~3 shows why the methodological critique still applies to the work of the IPCC even on a refined version of Betz's argument. Section~4 then considers an alternative way of defending the work of the IPCC which is in-line with, but does not clearly vindicate, the value-free ideal.},

  abstract = {Metaphorical language is used to convey one thing as representative or symbolic of something else. Metaphor is used in figurative language but is much more than a means of delivering ``poetic imagination''. A metaphor is a conceptual tool for categorising, organizing, thinking about, and ultimately shaping reality. Thus, metaphor underpins the way humans think. Our viewpoint is that metaphorical thought and communication contribute to ``painogenicity'', the tendency of socio-ecological environments (settings) to promote the persistence of pain. In this perspectives article, we explore the insidious nature of metaphor used in pain language and conceptual models of pain. We explain how metaphor shapes mental organisation to govern the way humans perceive, navigate and gain insight into the nature of the world, i.e., creating experience. We explain how people use metaphors to ``project'' their private sensations, feelings, and thoughts onto objects and events in the external world. This helps people to understand their pain and promotes sharing of pain experience with others, including health care professionals. We explore the insidious nature of ``warmongering'' and damage-based metaphors in daily parlance and demonstrate how this is detrimental to health and wellbeing. We explore how metaphors shape the development and communication of complex, abstract ideas, theories, and models and how scientific understanding of pain is metaphorical in nature. We argue that overly simplistic neuro-mechanistic metaphors of pain contribute to fallacies and misnomers and an unhealthy focus on biomedical research, in the hope of developing medical interventions that ``prevent pain transmission [sic]''. We advocate reconfiguring pain language towards constructive metaphors that foster a salutogenic view of pain, focusing on health and well-being. We advocate reconfiguring metaphors to align with contemporary pain science, to encourage acceptance of non-medicalised strategies to aid health and well-being. We explore the role of enactive metaphors to facilitate reconfiguration. We conclude that being cognisant of the pervasive nature of metaphors will assist progress toward a more coherent conceptual understanding of pain and the use of healthier pain language. We hope our article catalyses debate and reflection.},

The purpose of this study was to assess the test-retest reliability and the criterion-related and construct validity of a 30-s chair stand as a measure of lower body strength in adults over the age of 60 years. Seventy-six community-dwelling older adults (M age = 70.5 years) volunteered to participate in the study, which involved performing two 30-s chair-stand tests and two maximum leg-press tests, each conducted on separate days 2-5 days apart. Test-retest intraclass correlations of .84 for men and .92 for women, utilizing one-way analysis of variance procedures appropriate for a single trial, together with a nonsignificant change in scores from Day 1 testing to Day 2, indicate that the 30-s chair stand has good stability reliability. A moderately high correlation between chair-stand performance and maximum weight-adjusted leg-press performance for both men and women (r = .78 and .71, respectively) supports the criterion-related validity of the chair stand as a measure of lower body strength. Construct (or discriminant) validity of the chair stand was demonstrated by the test's ability to detect differences between various age and physical activity level groups. As expected, chair-stand performance decreased significantly across age groups in decades--from the 60s to the 70s to the 80s (p {$<$} .01) and was significantly lower for low-active participants than for high-active participants (p {$<$} .0001). It was concluded that the 30-s chair stand provides a reasonably reliable and valid indicator of lower body strength in generally active, community-dwelling older adults.},

  abstract = {For high-intensity muscular exercise, the time-to-exhaustion (t) increases as a predictable and hyperbolic function of decreasing power (P) or velocity (V). This relationship is highly conserved across diverse species and different modes of exercise and is well described by two parameters: the "critical power" (CP or CV), which is the asymptote for power or velocity, and the curvature constant (W{$\prime$}) of the relationship such that t = W{$\prime$}/(P - CP). CP represents the highest rate of energy transduction (oxidative ATP production, V˙O2) that can be sustained without continuously drawing on the energy store W{$\prime$} (composed in part of anaerobic energy sources and expressed in kilojoules). The limit of tolerance (time t) occurs when W{$\prime$} is depleted. The CP concept constitutes a practical framework in which to explore mechanisms of fatigue and help resolve crucial questions regarding the plasticity of exercise performance and muscular systems physiology. This brief review presents the practical and theoretical foundations for the CP concept, explores rigorous alternative mathematical approaches, and highlights exciting new evidence regarding its mechanistic bases and its broad applicability to human athletic performance.},

The Bland--Altman graphical method for assessing agreement between two observers using continuous measures was modified and extended to accommodate multiple observers. Mathematical formulae are derived and real data examples used to illustrate the proposed method.Results The examples show that the proposed graphical method of assessing agreement provides clinically useful information. This information includes estimates of the limits of agreement with the mean and a visual means for determining these limits over the range of measurements. In a data example that included five readers' measurements of 40 lung lesions, the intra-class correlation (ICC) was 0.84 indicating readers can reliably measure the lesions. However, the estimated limits of agreement with the mean were -1.1 to 1.1\,cm implying that the readers' measurements can plausibly differ from the mean estimated tumour size by more than 1\,cm. This is a clinically significant difference according to the study authors. In addition, a plot of the limits of agreement with the mean by mean tumour size shows heterogeneous agreement presumably due to the varying degrees of definition at the edge of the lesions.Conclusions The proposed graphical method of assessing agreement can be used alongside other measures such as ICC for reporting on reproducibility in studies of multiple observers making continuous measurements.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this mixed-studies systematic review was to ascertain the effectiveness of school-based interventions in increasing physical activity (PA) and/or reducing sedentary time (ST) in children aged 5-11 years, as well as to explore their effectiveness in relation to categories of the theory of expanded, extended, and enhanced opportunity (TEO). Methods: Adhering to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, 5 databases were searched using predefined search terms. Following title and abstract screening of 1115 records, the removal of duplicates (n\,=\,584) and articles that did not meet the inclusion criteria agreed to a priori (n\,=\,419) resulted in 112 records that were full-text screened. Two independent reviewers subsequently used the mixed-methods appraisal tool to assess the methodological quality of 57 full-text studies that met the inclusion criteria after full-text screening. The interventions were summarised using the TIDierR checklist and TEO. The strength of evidence was determined using a 5-level rating system utilising a published decision tree. Results: Overall evidence ratings for interventions implemented within school settings were: no evidence of effects on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and inconclusive evidence of effects on sedentary time. In relation to the TEO, expansion of PA appeared to be the most promising intervention type for MVPA, with moderate evidence of effect, whereas extension and enhancement of PA opportunity demonstrated no evidence of effect. A critical issue of possible compensatory behavior was identified by analysis of intervention effect in relation to PA measurement duration; when studies measured changes in PA during the actual intervention, there was moderate evidence of effect, whereas those that measured changes in PA during the school day presented inconclusive evidence of effect, and those that measured changes in PA over a whole day yielded no evidence of effect. Two meta-analyses of those studies using a whole-day accelerometer measure for MVPA or ST showed a significant but moderate effect for MVPA (effect size\,=\,0.51; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.02-0.99) and a large but nonsignificant effect for ST (effect size\,=\,1.15; 95\%CI: -1.03 to 3.33); both meta-analyses demonstrated low precision, considerable inconsistency, and high heterogeneity. Conclusion: The findings have important implications for future intervention research in terms of intervention design, implementation, and evaluation.},

The maximal oxygen (O2) uptake, O2 cost of running at sub-maximal speeds (running economy), and blood lactate response to exercise can all be determined using standard physiology laboratory exercise tests and the results used to track changes in `fitness' and to make recommendations for future training. PR's data demonstrate a 15\% improvement in running economy between 1992 and 2003 suggesting that improvements in this parameter are very important in allowing a distance runner to continue to improve their performance over the longer-term.

  abstract = {In this paper, I propose an account that accommodates the possibility of experimentation being exploratory in cases where the procedures necessary to plan and perform an experiment are dependent on the theoretical accounts of the phenomena under investigation. The present account suggests that experimental exploration requires the implementation of an exploratory procedure that serves to extend the range of possible outcomes of an experiment, thereby enabling it to pursue its objectives. Furthermore, I argue that the present account subsumes the notion of exploratory experimentation, which is often attributed in the relevant literature to the works of Friedrich Steinle and Richard Burian, as a particular type of experimental exploration carried out in the special cases where no well-formed theoretical framework of the phenomena under investigation (yet) exists. I illustrate the present account in the context of the ATLAS experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, where the long-sought Higgs boson has been discovered in 2012. I argue that the data selection procedure carried out in the ATLAS experiment illustrates an exploratory procedure in the sense suggested by the present account. I point out that this particular data selection procedure is theory-laden in that its implementation is crucially dependent on the theoretical models of high energy particle physics which the ATLAS experiment is aimed to test. However, I argue that the foregoing procedure is not driven by the above-mentioned theoretical models, but rather by a particular data selection strategy. I conclude that the ATLAS experiment illustrates that, contrary to what previous studies have suggested, there are cases of experimentation in which exploration serves to test theoretical predictions and that theory-ladenness plays an essential role in experimentation being exploratory.},

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half.

  abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology.

Greater gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy after partial range of motion training performed at long muscle lengths. J Strength Cond Res 37(9): 1746--1753, 2023---Whether there is an optimal range of motion (ROM) to induce muscle hypertrophy remains elusive, especially for gastrocnemius. This study aimed to compare the changes in gastrocnemius muscle thickness between calf raise exercise performed with full ROM (FULL ROM ), partial ROM performed in the initial (INITIAL ROM ), and final (FINAL ROM ) portions of the ROM. Forty-two young women performed a calf training program for 8 weeks, 3 days{$\cdot$}week -1 , with differences in the calf raise ROM configuration. The calf raise exercise was performed in a pin-loaded, horizontal, leg-press machine, in 3 sets of 15--20 repetition maximum. The subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 groups: FULL ROM (ankle: -25{$^\circ$} to +25{$^\circ$}), INITIAL ROM (ankle: -25{$^\circ$} to 0{$^\circ$}), and FINAL ROM (ankle: 0{$^\circ$} to +25{$^\circ$}), where 0{$^\circ$} was defined as an angle of 90{$^\circ$} of the foot with the tibia. The muscle thickness measurements of medial and lateral gastrocnemius were taken by means of B-mode ultrasound. INITIAL ROM elicited greater medial gastrocnemius increases than FULL ROM and FINAL ROM (INITIAL ROM = +15.2\% vs. FULL ROM = +6.7\% and FINAL ROM = +3.4\%; p {$\leq$} 0.009). Furthermore, INITIAL ROM elicited greater lateral gastrocnemius increases than FINAL ROM (INITIAL ROM = +14.9\% vs. FINAL ROM = +6.2\%; p {$<$} 0.024) but did not significantly differ from FULL ROM (FULL ROM = +7.3\%; p = 0.060). The current results suggest that calf training performed at longer muscle lengths may optimize gastrocnemius muscle hypertrophy in young women. Therefore, when prescribing hypertrophy-oriented training, the inclusion of the calf raise exercise performed with partial ROM in the initial portion of the excursion should be considered.},

  abstract = {In Concepts, Kinds, and Cognitive Development, Frank C. Keil provides a coherent account of how concepts and word meanings develop in children, adding to our understanding of the representational nature of concepts and word meanings at all ages.Keil argues that it is impossible to adequately understand the nature of conceptual representation without also considering the issue of learning. Weaving together issues in cognitive development, philosophy, and cognitive psychology, he reconciles numerous theories, backed by empirical evidence from nominal kinds studies, natural-kinds studies, and studies of fundamental categorical distinctions. He shows that all this evidence, when put together, leads to a better understanding of semantic and conceptual development.The book opens with an analysis of the problems of modeling qualitative changes in conceptual development, investigating how concepts of natural kinds, nominal kinds, and artifacts evolve.The studies on nominal kinds document a powerful and unambiguous developmental pattern indicating a shift from a reliance on global tabulations of characteristic features to what appears to be a small set of defining ones. The studies on natural kinds document an analogous shift toward a core theory instead of simple definition. Both sets of studies are strongly supported by cross cultural data.While these patterns seem to suggest that the young child organizes concepts according to characteristic features, Keil argues that there is a framework of conceptual categories and causal beliefs that enables even very young children to understand kinds at a deeper, theoretically guided, level. This account suggests a new way of understanding qualitative change and carries strong implications for how concepts are represented at any point in development.A Bradford Book},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether true interindividual response differences (IIRD) exist with respect to changes in anxiety because of aerobic exercise training in adults with fibromyalgia (FM). DATA SOURCES: Data from a previous meta-analytical database of randomized controlled trials of exercise in adults with arthritis and other rheumatic diseases. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials limited to aerobic exercise training on anxiety in adults 18 years or older with FM were included. DATA EXTRACTION: Change outcome SDs treated as point estimates for anxiety were used to calculate true IIRD from each study. In addition, treatment effect data were extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: The inverse variance heterogeneity model was used to pool all results. For the 5 studies and 321 participants in which results were pooled, statistically significant treatment effect reductions in anxiety were observed (mean, -0.77 points, 95\% CI, -1.25 to -0.77). However, no significant IIRD were found (mean, 0.6 points, 95\% CI, -1.2 to 1.5). The 95\% prediction interval for true IIRD in a future study was -1.7 to 0.8. The percent chance, ie, probability, of a clinically meaningful difference in variability, was 61.5\% (only possibly clinically important). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggest that aerobic exercise is associated with reductions in anxiety among adults with fibromyalgia. However, there is currently a lack of convincing evidence to support the notion that true IIRD exist. Therefore, a search for potential mediators and moderators associated with aerobic exercise and changes in anxiety among adults with FM may not be warranted. However, additional research is needed before any true level of certainty can be established. This includes (1) the assessment of IIRD in future randomized controlled trials, (2) randomized controlled trials of longer duration, and (3) an increase in the proportion of men included in randomized controlled trials.},

A systematic review of the literature according to the PRISMA statement included (a) controlled trials, (b) WB-EMS trials with at least one exercise and one control group, (c) WB-EMS as primary physical intervention, (d) WB-EMS with at least six electrodes covering most muscle groups, (e) non-athletic cohorts. We searched eight electronic databases up to June 30, 2020, without language restrictions. Standardized mean differences (SMD) for muscle mass parameters, total body fat mass, maximum leg extension, and trunk extension strength were defined as outcome measures. In summary, 16 studies with 19 individual WB-EMS groups representing 897 participants were included. Studies vary considerably with respect to age, BMI, and physical conditions. Impulse protocols of the studies were roughly comparable, but training frequency (1-5 sessions/week) and intervention length (6-54 weeks) differed between the studies. SMD average was 1.23 (95\%-CI: 0.71-1.76) for muscle mass, 0.98 (0.74-1.22) for maximum leg, and 1.08 (0.78-1.39) for maximum trunk extension strength changes (all p {$<$} 0.001). SMD for body fat changes (-0.40, [-0.98 to 0.17]), however, did not reach significance. I 2 and Q-statistics revealed substantial heterogeneity of muscle and fat mass changes between the trials. However, rank and regression tests did not indicate positive evidence for small-study bias and funnel plot asymmetries. This work provided further evidence for significant, large-sized effects of WB-EMS on muscle mass and strength parameters, but not on body fat mass.

PURPOSE: To examine weight training-related injuries in patients presenting to US emergency departments from 1990 to 2007. Study Design Descriptive epidemiology study. METHODS: Weight training-related injury data were analyzed from the US Consumer Product Safety Commission's National Electronic Injury Surveillance System. Sample weights provided by this organization calculated national estimates of weight training-related injuries from the 100-hospital sample. RESULTS: From 1990 to 2007, 25 335 weight training injuries were seen in US emergency departments, correlating to an estimated 970 801 injuries nationwide. Patients' mean age was 27.6 years (range, 6-100 years); 82.3\% were male. The upper trunk (25.3\%) and lower trunk (19.7\%) were the most commonly injured body parts. The most common diagnosis was sprain/strain (46.1\%). The most common mechanism of injury was weights dropping on the person (65.5\%). A large number of injuries occurred with free weights (90.4\%). Males had a larger proportion of upper trunk injuries (26.8\%; injury proportion ratio [IPR], 1.45; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.36-1.57; P {$<$}.001) than females (18.4\%). Females had a larger proportion of foot injuries (22.9\%; IPR, 2.09; 95\% CI: 1.93-2.26; P {$<$}.001) than males (11.0\%). Persons 12 years and younger had a larger proportion of hand (37.9\%; IPR, 2.08; 95\% CI: 1.76-2.46; P {$<$}.001) injuries than persons 13 years or older (18.2\%). Persons 55 years and older were injured more when using machines (18.2\%; IPR, 1.96; 95\% CI: 1.47-2.61, P {$<$}.001) than persons 54 years and younger (9.3\%). Persons using free weights sustained a greater proportion of fractures/dislocations (23.6\%; IPR, 2.44; 95\% CI: 1.92-3.09; P {$<$}.001) than persons using machines (9.7\%).

  abstract = {With this treatise, an insightful exploration of the probabilistic connection between philosophy and the history of science, John Maynard Keynes (1883--1946) breathed new life into studies of both disciplines. Originally published in 1921, the famous economist\&\#39;s most important mathematical work represented a significant contribution to the theory regarding the logical probability of propositions. Keynes effectively dismantled the classical theory of probability, launching what has since been termed the \&quot;logical-relationist\&quot; theory. In so doing, he explored the logical relationships between classifying a proposition as \&quot;highly probable\&quot; and as a \&quot;justifiable induction.\&quot; A Treatise on Probability argues that probability is a matter of logic, which renders it objective: a statement involving probability relations possesses a truth value independent of opinion. Keynes demonstrates that if a hypothesis has even the smallest finite probability, it can be transformed into certainty by a sufficient number of observations. This is his attempt to overcome Humean skepticism by asserting that theoretically grounded hypotheses need only exhibit finite probability to form the basis of science and rational action. Another key idea discussed in A Treatise on Probability is that probability relations constitute only a partially ordered set in the sense that two probabilities cannot necessarily always be compared. Keynes further maintains that probability is a basic concept that cannot be reduced to other concepts.},

  abstract = {Background: The triceps surae muscle plays important roles in fundamental human movements. However, this muscle is relatively unresponsive to resistance training (difficult to hypertrophy) but prone to atrophy with inactivity compared with other muscles. Thus, identifying an effective training modality for the triceps surae is warranted. This study compared triceps surae muscle hypertrophy after standing/knee-extended versus seated/knee-flexed plantarflexion (calf-raise) training, where the gastrocnemius is lengthened and shortened, respectively. Methods: Fourteen untrained adults conducted calf-raise training with one leg in a standing/knee-extended position and the other leg in a seated/knee 90{$^\circ$}-flexed position at 70\% of one-repetition maximum. Each leg performed 10 repetitions/set, 5 sets/session, 2 sessions/week for 12 weeks. Before and after the intervention, magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained to assess muscle volume of each and the whole triceps surae. Results : Muscle volume significantly increased in all three muscles and the whole triceps surae for both legs ( p {$\leq$} 0.031), except for the gastrocnemius muscles of the seated condition leg ( p = 0.147--0.508). The changes in muscle volume were significantly greater for the standing than seated condition leg in the lateral gastrocnemius (12.4\% vs. 1.7\%), medial gastrocnemius (9.2\% vs. 0.6\%), and whole triceps surae (5.6\% vs. 2.1\%) ( p {$\leq$} 0.011), but similar between legs in the soleus (2.1\% vs. 2.9\%, p = 0.410). Conclusion: Standing calf-raise was by far more effective, therefore recommended, than seated calf-raise for inducing muscle hypertrophy of the gastrocnemius and consequently the whole triceps surae. This result and similar between-condition hypertrophy in the soleus collectively suggest that training at long muscle lengths promotes muscle hypertrophy.}

  abstract = {Over the past few years, customer relationship management and loyalty programs (LPs) have been widely adopted by companies and have received a great deal of attention from marketers, consultants, and, to a lesser degree, academics. In this research, the authors examine the effect of the level of effort required to obtain an LP reward on consumers' perception of the LP's attractiveness. The authors propose that in certain conditions, increasing program requirements can enhance consumers' likelihood of joining the program, thus leading consumers to prefer a dominated option. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that consumers often evaluate LPs on the basis of their individual effort to obtain the reward relative to the relevant reference effort (e.g., the effort of typical other consumers). When consumers believe they have an effort advantage over typical others (i.e., an idiosyncratic fit with the LP), higher program requirements magnify this perception of advantage and can therefore increase the overall perceived value of the program. The authors support this proposition in a series of studies in which the perceived idiosyncratic fit was manipulated either by reducing the individual effort or by raising the reference effort. The authors' findings also indicate that (1) idiosyncratic fit considerations are elicited spontaneously, (2) idiosyncratic fit mediates the effect of effort on consumer response to LPs, and (3) an alternative account for the results based on signaling is not supported. The authors conclude that the findings are part of a broader phenomenon, which they term the ?idiosyncratic fit heuristic,? whereby a key factor that affects consumers' response to marketing programs and promotional offers is the perceived relative advantage or fit with consumers' idiosyncratic conditions and preferences.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Diurnal variations in physical performance can affect athletes' success in competitive sports depending on whether the time of peak performance concurs with the time of competition. The purpose of this systematic review was to investigate the diurnal variation in maximum endurance and strength performance. METHODS: The databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched from inception to November 2020. The search string was externally reviewed according to PRESS guidelines, and the review was conducted in accordance to PRISMA guidelines and registered beforehand on PROSPERO. Eligibility criteria were that 1) the studies included humans and 2) any kind of maximum endurance or maximum strength test was performed at 3) a minimum of three different times of the day. There were no restrictions regarding study design, participants' sex, age, or fitness levels. RESULTS: From 10,460 screened articles, 63 articles met all three inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis on the harmonizable 29 studies provided evidence for diurnal variations in physical performance. In detail, the overall effect sizes (95\% confidence intervals) were 0.23 (0.05-0.40), 0.73 (0.37-1.09), 0.39 (0.18-0.60), and 0.79 (0.28-1.30) for endurance exercise tests, maximum power output in the Wingate test, handgrip strength, and jump height, respectively, all in favor of higher performance in the evening. The overall risk of bias in individual studies was moderately high. CONCLUSIONS: There is strong evidence that anaerobic power and jump height are maximal between 1300 and 2000 h. There is some evidence that handgrip strength peaks between 1400 and 2100 h, but only little evidence that there is a time of peak performance in maximum endurance.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)gamma is a transcription factor involved in glucose homeostasis and energy metabolism. A missense mutation at codon 12 in the PPARgamma2 has been associated with increased body mass index (BMI) and attenuated insulin resistance (IR) in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We have recently shown a decreased basic metabolic rate (BMR) in PCOS. The aim of the present study is to determine the prevalence of the Pro12Ala polymorphism of the PPARgamma2 gene and its associations with indices of IR and BMR in lean and slightly overweight PCOS women. DESIGN: Case-control association study involving 156 PCOS women with biochemical hyperandrogenism, chronic anovulation and polycystic ovarian morphology in ultrasound and 56 unrelated healthy controls. METHODS: Hormonal determinations were performed by electrochemiluminescence quantitation or RIA. BMR was measured by indirect calorimetry. All subjects were genotyped by a PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. RESULTS: Genotype frequencies of the Pro12Ala polymorphism in PPARgamma2 did not differ among PCOS women and control subjects. The presence of Pro12Ala polymorphism of PPARgamma2 was associated with lower BMR (P=0.04). This finding was valid in our subgroup of lean PCOS (BMI{$<$}25 kg/m(2)), in which the Ala variant was also associated with higher total testosterone values. CONCLUSION: The Pro12Ala polymorphism in the PPARgamma2 gene is associated with decreased BMR in women with PCOS and biochemical hyperandrogenemia. These young women are therefore at risk to increase their body weight and should restrict their energy intake by diet and enhance their energy expenditure by exercise.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) is a widely used reliability index in test-retest, intrarater, and interrater reliability analyses. This article introduces the basic concept of ICC in the content of reliability analysis. DISCUSSION FOR RESEARCHERS: There are 10 forms of ICCs. Because each form involves distinct assumptions in their calculation and will lead to different interpretations, researchers should explicitly specify the ICC form they used in their calculation. A thorough review of the research design is needed in selecting the appropriate form of ICC to evaluate reliability. The best practice of reporting ICC should include software information, "model," "type," and "definition" selections. DISCUSSION FOR READERS: When coming across an article that includes ICC, readers should first check whether information about the ICC form has been reported and if an appropriate ICC form was used. Based on the 95\% confident interval of the ICC estimate, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.90 are indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent reliability, respectively. CONCLUSION: This article provides a practical guideline for clinical researchers to choose the correct form of ICC and suggests the best practice of reporting ICC parameters in scientific publications. This article also gives readers an appreciation for what to look for when coming across ICC while reading an article.},

Data were analyzed for left and right wrists for the female subjects and for the right wrist of males. The low strength females demonstrated the smallest error variance estimates for trials and days on both wrists. Middle and high strength females exhibited error variance estimates two to three times larger than the low strength females. Right wrist data on male subjects showed the largest error variance, with trials and day error variances some two to four times larger than the female subjects. Since error variance seems to be related to the magnitude of the strength score, further caution is indicated in the interpretation of reliability estimates for strength measures expressed in the form of a single reliability coefficient. The possibility that the importance of motivation in reliable assessment of maximal isometric strength may have been exaggerated was also discussed.}

  abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the influences of isometric training at different joint angles on the muscle size and function of the human muscle--tendon complex in vivo . Furthermore, we tried to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in angle specificity after isometric training from the aspect of neuromuscular adaptation and the changes in the properties of the muscle--tendon complex. Nine males completed 12-week unilateral training program (70\% of maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) \texttimes{} 15{$\quad$}s \texttimes{} six sets) on the knee extensors at 50{$^\circ$} (shorter muscle length: ST) and 100{$^\circ$} (longer muscle length: LT). The internal muscle force (mechanical stress) is higher at 100{$^\circ$} than at 50{$^\circ$} because of the difference in the moment arm length, although there were no difference in the relative torque level, contraction and relaxation times, and repetition between ST and LT. Before and after training, isometric strength at eight angles and muscle volume were determined. Tendon elongation of knee extensors was measured by ultrasonography. There was no significant difference in the rate of increment of muscle volume between the protocols. Tendon stiffness increased significantly for LT, but not for ST. Although significant gain was limited to angles at or near the training angle for ST, increases in MVC at all angles were found for LT. These results suggest that only mechanical stress (internal muscle force imposed on muscle and tendon) contributes to adaptation in the tendon stiffness, although metabolic (relative torque level, etc.) and mechanical stress relate to muscle hypertrophy. Furthermore, increment of tendon stiffness for LT might contribute to increase torque output at smaller angles other than the training angle.},

In it, he challenged long-standing assumptions about scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don't arise from the gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation, but instead occur outside of ``normal science.'' Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in today's biotech age (Science).This new edition of Kuhn's essential work includes an insightful introduction by Ian Hacking, which clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including ``paradigm'' and ``incommensurability,'' and applies Kuhn's ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking's introduction provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. This newly designed edition also includes an expanded and updated index.},

High achievers more frequently attributed their successes or failures to the degree of effort expended than did either intermediate or low achievers, while intermediate achievers ascribed outcomes to luck more often than either of the extreme achievement groups. In Exp. II and III, the attributions typical of high and low achievers were induced in 2 experimental groups, with the prediction that these groups would diverge behaviorally in the same way as uninstructed high and low achievers. In both digit-guessing and anagram tasks, high-achieving Ss performed as predicted, while low-achieving Ss failed to be differentially affected by the 2 instructions. Possible explanations for this pattern of results are discussed. (16 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Although multitasking has been the subject of a large number of papers and experiments, the term task is still not well defined. In this opinion paper, we adopt the ideomotor perspective to define the term task and distinguish it from the terms goal and action. In our opinion, actions are movements executed by an actor to achieve a concrete goal. Concrete goals are represented as anticipated sensory consequences that are associated with an action in an ideomotor manner. Concrete goals are nested in a hierarchy of more and more abstract goals, which form the context of the corresponding action. Finally, tasks are depersonalized goals, i.e., goals that should be achieved by someone. However, tasks can be assigned to a specific person or group of persons, either by a third party or by the person or the group of persons themselves. By accepting this assignment, the depersonalized task becomes a personal goal. In our opinion, research on multitasking needs to confine its scope to the analysis of concrete tasks, which result in concrete goals as anticipated sensory consequences of the corresponding action. We further argue that the distinction between dual- and single-tasking is dependent on the subjective conception of the task assignment, the goal representation and previous experience. Finally, we conclude that it is not the tasks, but the performing of the tasks, i.e. the actions that cause costs in multitasking experiments.},

Given these challenges, I derive and compare two new estimators that help correct this small-sample bias, and update guidelines and diagnostics for assessing when the response ratio is appropriate for ecological meta-analysis. These new bias-corrected estimators retain much of the original utility of the response ratio and are aimed to improve the quality and reliability of inferences with effect sizes based on the log ratio of two means.},

Their discussion (which mirrors certain real developments in the history of mathematics) raises some philosophical problems and some problems about the nature of mathematical discovery or creativity. Imre Lakatos is concerned throughout to combat the classical picture of mathematical development as a steady accumulation of established truths. He shows that mathematics grows instead through a richer, more dramatic process of the successive improvement of creative hypotheses by attempts to 'prove' them and by criticism of these attempts: the logic of proofs and refutations.},

The key aim of a sample size justification for such studies is to explain how the collected data is expected to provide valuable information given the inferential goals of the researcher. In this overview article six approaches are discussed to justify the sample size in a quantitative empirical study: 1) collecting data from (almost) the entire population, 2) choosing a sample size based on resource constraints, 3) performing an a-priori power analysis, 4) planning for a desired accuracy, 5) using heuristics, or 6) explicitly acknowledging the absence of a justification. An important question to consider when justifying sample sizes is which effect sizes are deemed interesting, and the extent to which the data that is collected informs inferences about these effect sizes. Depending on the sample size justification chosen, researchers could consider 1) what the smallest effect size of interest is, 2) which minimal effect size will be statistically significant, 3) which effect sizes they expect (and what they base these expectations on), 4) which effect sizes would be rejected based on a confidence interval around the effect size, 5) which ranges of effects a study has sufficient power to detect based on a sensitivity power analysis, and 6) which effect sizes are expected in a specific research area. Researchers can use the guidelines presented in this article, for example by using the interactive form in the accompanying online Shiny app, to improve their sample size justification, and hopefully, align the informational value of a study with their inferential goals.},

I provide examples of how researchers can present deviations from preregistrations and evaluate the consequences of the deviation when encountering 1) unforeseen events, 2) errors in the preregistration, 3) missing information, 4) violations of untested assumptions, and 5) falsification of auxiliary hypotheses. The current manuscript aims to provide a principled approach to deciding when to deviate from a preregistration and how to report deviations from an error-statistical philosophy grounded in methodological falsificationism. The goal is to help researchers reflect on the consequence of deviations from preregistrations by evaluating the test's severity and the validity of the inference.},

Eating disorders (EDs) are psychiatric conditions that may impact the development of PCOS and comorbidities including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes. The aim of this scoping review was to determine the prevalence of EDs and disordered eating, and to review the etiology of EDs in PCOS. The review was conducted using search terms addressing PCOS, EDs, and disordered eating in databases, including PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and CINAHL. Structured interviews, self-administered questionnaires, chart review, or self-reported diagnosis were used to identify EDs in 38 studies included in the review. The prevalence of any ED in those with PCOS ranged from 0\% to 62\%. Those with PCOS were 3-6-fold more likely to have an ED and higher odds ratios (ORs) of an elevated ED score compared with controls. In those with PCOS, 30\% had a higher OR of bulimia nervosa and binge ED was 3-fold higher compared with controls. Studies were limited on anorexia nervosa and other specified feeding or ED (such as night eating syndrome) and these were not reported to be higher in PCOS. To our knowledge, no studies reported on avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder, rumination disorder, or pica in PCOS. Studies showed strong associations between overweight, body dissatisfaction, and disordered eating in PCOS. The etiologic development of EDs in PCOS remains unclear; however, psychological, metabolic, hypothalamic, and genetic factors are implicated. The prevalence of any ED in PCOS varied because of the use of different diagnostic and screening tools. Screening of all individuals with PCOS for EDs is recommended and high-quality studies on the prevalence, pathogenesis of specific EDs, relationship to comorbidities, and effective interventions to treat ED in those with PCOS are needed.},

The procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first-order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa-type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.},

This method promises to empower scholars with a quantitative and data-driven tool to study culture and society, but its power has been limited by the use of data from books and simple analytics based essentially on word counts. This study addresses these problems by assembling a vast corpus of regional newspapers from the United Kingdom, incorporating very fine-grained geographical and temporal information that is not available for books. The corpus spans 150 years and is formed by millions of articles, representing 14\% of all British regional outlets of the period. Simple content analysis of this corpus allowed us to detect specific events, like wars, epidemics, coronations, or conclaves, with high accuracy, whereas the use of more refined techniques from artificial intelligence enabled us to move beyond counting words by detecting references to named entities. These techniques allowed us to observe both a systematic underrepresentation and a steady increase of women in the news during the 20th century and the change of geographic focus for various concepts. We also estimate the dates when electricity overtook steam and trains overtook horses as a means of transportation, both around the year 1900, along with observing other cultural transitions. We believe that these data-driven approaches can complement the traditional method of close reading in detecting trends of continuity and change in historical corpora.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Data on dietary intake, meal patterns, and eating attitudes from women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is limited despite the fact that PCOS is associated with obesity. We aimed to test the hypothesis that women with PCOS display altered dietary intakes and eating behaviors compared to controls. METHODS: Women with PCOS (n = 72) as defined according to the modified Rotterdam criteria were compared with healthy controls (n = 30). Anthropometry included measurement of waist circumference and determination of the resting metabolic rate via indirect calorimetry. All women completed questionnaires regarding eating behavior; Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire (TFEQ-R21) and eating attitudes; Eating Attitudes Test (EAT). Group comparisons were done by Mann-Whitney U test and logistic regression analysis was used for adjustments of age and BMI in a non-parametric way. RESULTS: BMI was higher in women with PCOS compared to controls. Resting metabolic rate did not differ between women with women with and without PCOS after adjustment for age and BMI [1411 \textpm{} 229 kcal/day versus 1325 \textpm{} 193 kcal per day (P = 0.07)], whereas the respiratory exchange ratio was higher in women with PCOS than in controls [0.83 \textpm{} 0.07 versus 0.78 \textpm{} 0.08 (P = 0.02 after adjustments for age and BMI)]. Energy percent (E\%) carbohydrates was higher in women with PCOS compared to controls (P = 0.017), but E\% alcohol was lower (P = 0.036) after adjustment for age and BMI. The average total EAT scores and EAT dieting subscale scores were higher in women with PCOS compared with controls (P = 0.001 and P = 0.024, respectively) after adjustment for age and BMI. No difference was found for previous or current symptoms of bulimia nervosa. CONCLUSIONS: Independent of BMI and age, the resting metabolic rate did not differ between women with and without PCOS indicating that women with PCOS should have equal abilities in terms of energy metabolism to lose weight as women without PCOS. Women with PCOS showed greater concerns about their weight and dieting, and this indicates that anxiety about weight is one of the psychological symptoms of PCOS.},

The majority of RT regimens does not discriminate between upper and lower body muscle groups, while these groups may respond differently to RT set volumes in terms of maximum skeletal muscle mass gain. Recent studies have examined the effect of different set volumes on the extent of UBMH to formulate optimal RT regimens and to make RT programmes more time-efficient. OBJECTIVE: To analyse the effect of the number of RT sets on the extent of UBMH on the basis of recent literature. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: The analysis suggests that, statistically, high set volumes ({$\geq$}3) are not significantly better than low set volumes ({$<$}3) in regard to UBMH in untrained subjects. For trained subjects, the literature is lacking in well-designed studies comparing low and high training volumes, as well as analysing upper and lower body muscles separately. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that high volume of sets offers better results than low volume of sets for UBMH, and vice versa.},

  abstract = {Resistance training (RT) is a fundamental component of exercise prescription aimed at improving overall health and function. RT techniques such as cluster set (CS) configurations, characterized by additional short intra-set or inter-repetition rest intervals, have been shown to maintain acute muscular force, velocity, and 'power' outputs across a RT session, and facilitate positive longer-term neuromuscular adaptations. However, to date CS have mainly been explored from a human performance perspective despite potential for application in health and clinical exercise settings. Therefore, this current opinion piece aims~to highlight emerging evidence and provide a rationale for why CS may be an advantageous RT technique for older adults, and across several neurological, neuromuscular, cardiovascular and pulmonary settings. Specifically, CS may minimize acute fatigue and adverse physiologic responses, improve patient tolerance of RT and promote functional adaptations (i.e., force, velocity, and power). Moreover, we propose that CS may be a particularly useful exercise rehabilitation technique where injury or illness, persistent fatigue, weakness and dysfunction exist. We further suggest that CS offer an alternative RT strategy that can be easily implemented alongside existing exercise/rehabilitation programs requiring no extra cost, minimal upskilling and/or time commitment for the patient and professional. In light of the emerging evidence and likely efficacy in clinical exercise practice, future research should move toward further direct investigation of CS-based RT in a variety of adverse health conditions and across the lifespan given the already demonstrated benefits in healthy populations.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Several retrospective studies of strength sport athletes have reported strength adaptations over months to years; however, such adaptations are not linear. METHODS: We explored changes in strength over time in a large, retrospective sample of powerlifting (PL) athletes. Specifically, we examined the rate and magnitude of strength adaptation based on age category and weight class for PL competition total, and the squat, bench press, and deadlift, respectively. Mixed effects growth modelling was performed for each operationalised performance outcome (squat, bench press, deadlift, and total) as the dependent variables, with outcomes presented on both the raw, untransformed time scale and on the common logarithmic scale. Additionally, the fitted values were rescaled as a percentage. RESULTS: Collectively, the greatest strength gains were in the earliest phase of PL participation (\textasciitilde\,7.5-12.5\% increase in the first year, and up to an\,\textasciitilde\,20\% increase after 10~years). Females tended to display faster progression, possibly because of lower baseline strength. Additionally, female Masters 3 and 4 athletes ({$>$}\,59~years) still displayed\,\textasciitilde\,2.5-5.0\% strength improvement, but a slight strength loss was observed in Masters 4 ({$>$}\,69~years) males (\textasciitilde\,0.35\%/year). CONCLUSION: Although directly applicable to PL, these findings provide population-level support for the role of consistent and continued strength training to improve strength across the age span and, importantly, to mitigate, or at least largely attenuate age-related declines in strength compared to established general population norms. This information should be used to encourage participation in strength sports, resistance training more generally, and to support future public health messaging.},

  abstract = {We live in a society which sets great store by science. Scientific `experts' play a privileged role in many of our institutions, ranging from the courts of law to the corridors of power. At a more fundamental level, most of us strive to shape our beliefs about the natural world in the `scientific' image. If scientists say that continents move or that the universe is billions of years old, we generally believe them, however counter-intuitive and implausible their claims might appear to be. Equally, we tend to acquiesce in what scientists tell us not to believe. If, for instance, scientists say that Velikovsky was a crank, that the biblical creation story is hokum, that UFOs do not exist, or that acupuncture is ineffective, then we generally make the scientist's contempt for these things our own, reserving for them those social sanctions and disapprobations which are the just deserts of quacks, charlatans and con-men. In sum, much of our intellectual life, and increasingly large portions of our social and political life, rest on the assumption that we (or, if not we ourselves, then someone whom we trust in these matters) can tell the difference between science and its counterfeit.},

However, effectiveness of scaled-up pneumatic machine resistance training in the community is not known. We evaluated the effectiveness of a multi-site community-delivered 12-week pneumatic machine resistance programme (Gym Tonic (GT)) on muscle strength and physical function in older adults. METHODS: Three hundred eighteen community-dwelling older adults aged {$\geq$}65\,years were randomized into 12-week (twice/week) coach-supervised-community-based-GT-programme(n~=\,168) and wait-list control groups(n~=\,150). After 12\,weeks, the intervention group continued with GT-training and the control group received supervised-GT-programme for further 12\,weeks (partial-crossover-design). Fried frailty score, lower-extremity muscle strength and physical function (i.e., fast and habitual gait-speed, balance, repeated-chair-sit-to-stand, short physical performance battery (SPPB)) were determined at baseline, 12 and 24\,weeks. Analysis adopted a modified-intention-to-treat-approach. RESULTS: After 12\,weeks, lower-extremity muscle strength improved by 11-26\%(all p\,{$<~$}0.05) and fast gait-speed improved by 7\%(p~=\,0.008) in GT-intervention group(n~=\,132) than controls(n~=\,118), regardless of frailty status. Other physical function performance did not differ between control and intervention groups after 12\,weeks (all p~{$>$}\,0.05). Frailty score improved by 0.5 in the intervention but not control group(p~=\,0.004). Within the intervention group, lower-extremity muscle strength and physical function outcomes improved at 24\,weeks compared with baseline (all p~{$<$}\,0.001). Within controls, lower-extremity muscle strength, SPPB, repeated-chair-sit-to-stand and fast gait-speed improved post-GT (24-week) compared to both pre-GT (12-week) and baseline. Programme adherence was high in intervention [0-12-weeks,90\%(SD,13\%); 12-24-weeks,89\%(SD,17\%)] and control [12-24-weeks,90\%(SD,19\%)] groups. CONCLUSION: Community-delivered GT resistance training programme with pneumatic machines has high adherence, improves muscle strength and fast gait-speed, and can be effectively implemented at scale for older adults. Future studies could examine if including other multi-modal function-specific training to complement GT can achieve better physical/functional performance in power, balance and endurance tasks.

DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: University practice. PATIENT(S): Women with PCOS (Rotterdam criteria; n = 148) and controls seen for routine gynecologic care (n = 106) from 2015 to~2016. INTERVENTION(S): Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (EDE-Q), Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire (PCOSQ). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): EDE-Q and NEQ scores, prevalence of bulimia nervosa (BN), binge eating disorder (BED), and night eating syndrome (NES). RESULT(S): Women with PCOS were at an increased risk for overall abnormal EDE-Q scores compared with controls (12.16\% vs. 2.83\%; odds ratio [OR], 4.75; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.36, 16.58). Clinically significant elevated scores were noted for shape and weight concern. In unadjusted analysis, body mass index (OR, 1.06; 95\% CI, 1.01, 1.11), elevated depression score (OR, 5.43; 95\% CI, 1.85, 15.88), and elevated anxiety score (OR, 6.60; 95\% CI, 2.45, 17.76) were associated with an abnormal EDE-Q global score. In the multivariable model, PCOS was associated with abnormal EDE-Q global score (adjusted OR, 4.67; 95\% CI, 1.16, 18.80). Elevated EDE-Q scores inversely correlated with PCOSQ scores (r = -0.57). The prevalence of BN was 6.1\%, of BED was 17.6\%, and of NES was 12.9\% in women with PCOS, with no differences compared with controls. CONCLUSION(S): Women with PCOS, especially those with concurrent anxiety symptoms but independent of obesity, have a significantly increased risk of abnormal EDE-Q scores. Our findings suggest the need for routine screening for ED in this population.},

  abstract = {The current CONSORT guidelines for reporting pilot trials do not recommend hypothesis testing of clinical outcomes on the basis that a pilot trial is under-powered to detect such differences and this is the aim of the main trial. It states that primary evaluation should focus on descriptive analysis of feasibility/process outcomes (e.g. recruitment, adherence, treatment fidelity). Whilst the argument for not testing clinical outcomes is justifiable, the same does not necessarily apply to feasibility/process outcomes, where differences may be large and detectable with small samples. Moreover, there remains much ambiguity around sample size for pilot trials. Many pilot trials adopt a `traffic light' system for evaluating progression to the main trial determined by a set of criteria set up a priori. We construct a hypothesis testing approach for binary feasibility outcomes focused around this system that tests against being in the RED zone (unacceptable outcome) based on an expectation of being in the GREEN zone (acceptable outcome) and choose the sample size to give high power to reject being in the RED zone if the GREEN zone holds true. Pilot point estimates falling in the RED zone will be statistically non-significant and in the GREEN zone will be significant; the AMBER zone designates potentially acceptable outcome and statistical tests may be significant or non-significant. For example, in relation to treatment fidelity, if we assume the upper boundary of the RED zone is 50\% and the lower boundary of the GREEN zone is 75\% (designating unacceptable and acceptable treatment fidelity, respectively), the sample size required for analysis given 90\% power and one-sided 5\% alpha would be around n = 34 (intervention group alone). Observed treatment fidelity in the range of 0--17 participants (0--50\%) will fall into the RED zone and be statistically non-significant, 18--25 (51--74\%) fall into AMBER and may or may not be significant and 26--34 (75--100\%) fall into GREEN and will be significant indicating acceptable fidelity. In general, several key process outcomes are assessed for progression to a main trial; a composite approach would require appraising the rules of progression across all these outcomes. This methodology provides a formal framework for hypothesis testing and sample size indication around process outcome evaluation for pilot RCTs.},

While the present problem has received little attention, the studies of effort can be divided into two major areas: (a) Is effort an aversive stimulus, to be avoided in a choice situation and resulting in decrements in response strength? (b) Can effort once expended affect the stimulus-event (reward) associated with that effort? The available literature does not provide any conclusive statements concerning the aversive effect of effort. However, effort does seem to enhance the value of a stimulus associated with the expenditure of effort. (38 ref.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

The clarity and transparency of these reports, however, is not optimal. Poor reporting of systematic reviews diminishes their value to clinicians, policy makers, and other users. Since the development of the QUOROM (QUality Of Reporting Of Meta-analysis) Statement--a reporting guideline published in 1999--there have been several conceptual, methodological, and practical advances regarding the conduct and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Also, reviews of published systematic reviews have found that key information about these studies is often poorly reported. Realizing these issues, an international group that included experienced authors and methodologists developed PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) as an evolution of the original QUOROM guideline for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of evaluations of health care interventions. The PRISMA Statement consists of a 27-item checklist and a four-phase flow diagram. The checklist includes items deemed essential for transparent reporting of a systematic review. In this Explanation and Elaboration document, we explain the meaning and rationale for each checklist item. For each item, we include an example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies and methodological literature. The PRISMA Statement, this document, and the associated Web site (http://www.prisma-statement.org/) should be helpful resources to improve reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses.},

Terrorism, global pandemics, and environmental catastrophes are just a few of the risks that dominate media coverage. Is this public discourse on risk disconnected from reality? To examine this issue, we analyzed the dynamics of the risk discourse in two natural language text corpora. Specifically, we tracked latent semantic patterns over a period of 150\,years to address four questions: First, we examined how the frequency of the word risk has changed over historical time. Is the construct of risk playing an ever-increasing role in the public discourse, as the sociological notion of a `risk society' suggests? Second, we investigated how the sentiments for the words co-occurring with risk have changed. Are the connotations of risk becoming increasingly ominous? Third, how has the meaning of risk changed relative to close associates such as danger and hazard? Is risk more subject to semantic change? Finally, we decompose the construct of risk into the specific topics with which it has been associated and track those topics over historical time. This brief history of the semantics of risk reveals new and surprising insights---a fourfold increase in frequency, increasingly negative sentiment, a semantic drift toward forecasting and prevention, and a shift away from war toward chronic disease---reflecting the conceptual evolution of risk in the archeological records of public discourse.},

This involves understanding changes in what words meant, how words were used, and how these changes may have responded to changes in the environment, such as in healthcare, wealth disparity, and war. Here we make available a tool, the Macroscope, for studying historical changes in language over the last two centuries. The Macroscope uses over 155 billion words of historical text, which will grow as we include new historical corpora, and derives word properties from frequency-of-usage and co-occurrence patterns over time. Using co-occurrence patterns, the Macroscope can track changes in semantics, allowing researchers to identify semantically stable and unstable words in historical text and providing quantitative information about changes in a word's valence, arousal, and concreteness, as well as information about new properties, such as semantic drift. The Macroscope provides information about both the local and global properties of words, as well as information about how these properties change over time, allowing researchers to visualize and download data in order to make inferences about historical psychology. Although quantitative historical psychology represents a largely new field of study, we see this work as complementing a wealth of other historical investigations, offering new insights and new approaches to understanding existing theory.

  abstract = {Skeletal muscle plays a critical role in physical function and metabolic health. Muscle is a highly adaptable tissue that responds to resistance exercise (RE; loading) by hypertrophying, or during muscle disuse, RE mitigates muscle loss. Resistance exercise training (RET)--induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy is a product of external (e.g., RE programming, diet, some supplements) and internal variables (e.g., mechanotransduction, ribosomes, gene expression, satellite cells activity). RE is undeniably the most potent nonpharmacological external variable to stimulate the activation/suppression of internal variables linked to muscular hypertrophy or countering disuse-induced muscle loss. Here, we posit that despite considerable research on the impact of external variables on RET and hypertrophy, internal variables (i.e., inherent skeletal muscle biology) are dominant in regulating the extent of hypertrophy in response to external stimuli. Thus, identifying the key internal skeletal muscle--derived variables that mediate the translation of external RE variables will be pivotal to determining the most effective strategies for skeletal muscle hypertrophy in healthy persons. Such work will aid in enhancing function in clinical populations, slowing functional decline, and promoting physical mobility. We provide up-to-date, evidence-based perspectives of the mechanisms regulating RET-induced skeletal muscle hypertrophy.},

This review summarizes recent insight into the mechanisms behind how titin gene mutations cause hereditary cardiomyopathy and how titin protein is mechanically active in skeletal and cardiac myocytes. A main theme is the evolving role of titin as a modulator of contraction. Topics include strain-sensing via titin in the sarcomeric A-band as the basis for length-dependent activation, titin elastic recoil and refolding of titin domains as an energy source, and Ca 2+ -dependent stiffening of titin stretched during eccentric muscle contractions. Findings suggest that titin stiffness is a principal regulator of the contractile behavior of striated muscle. Physiological or pathological changes to titin stiffness therefore affect contractility. Taken together, titin emerges as a linker element between passive and active myocyte properties.},

  abstract = {Conventional wisdom has it that the sciences, properly pursued, constitute a pure, value-free method of obtaining knowledge about the natural world. In light of the social and normative dimensions of many scientific debates, Helen Longino finds that general accounts of scientific methodology cannot support this common belief. Focusing on the notion of evidence, the author argues that a methodology powerful enough to account for theories of any scope and depth is incapable of ruling out the influence of social and cultural values in the very structuring of knowledge. The objectivity of scientific inquiry can nevertheless be maintained, she proposes, by understanding scientific inquiry as a social rather than an individual process. Seeking to open a dialogue between methodologists and social critics of the sciences, Longino develops this concept of "contextual empiricism" in an analysis of research programs that have drawn criticism from feminists. Examining theories of human evolution and of prenatal hormonal determination of "gender-role" behavior, of sex differences in cognition, and of sexual orientation, the author shows how assumptions laden with social values affect the description, presentation, and interpretation of data. In particular, Longino argues that research on the hormonal basis of "sex-differentiated behavior" involves assumptions not only about gender relations but also about human action and agency. She concludes with a discussion of the relation between science, values, and ideology, based on the work of Habermas, Foucault, Keller, and Haraway.},

This has the advantage that selection bias and confounding due to between-group differences are limited. However, the basic interrupted time series design cannot exclude confounding due to co-interventions or other events occurring around the time of the intervention. One approach to minimizse potential confounding from such simultaneous events is to add a control series so that there is both a before-after comparison and an intervention-control group comparison. A range of different types of controls can be used with interrupted time series designs, each of which has associated strengths and limitations. Researchers undertaking controlled interrupted time series studies should carefully consider a priori what confounding events may exist and whether different controls can exclude these or if they could introduce new sources of bias to the study. A prudent approach to the design, analysis and interpretation of controlled interrupted time series studies is required to ensure that valid information on the effectiveness of health interventions can be ascertained.},

First, I argue that the truth values of scientific statements depend on ontological choices. For example, statements about entities such as species, race, memory, intelligence, depression, or obesity are true or false relative to the choice of a biological, psychological, or medical ontology. Second, I show that ontological choices often depend on non-epistemic values. On the basis of these premises, I argue that it is often neither possible nor desirable to evaluate scientific statements independently of non-epistemic values. Finally, I suggest that considerations of ontological choices do not only challenge the value-free ideal but also help to specify positive roles of non-epistemic values in an often neglected area of scientific practice.},

In this article, I instead argue that formal modelling cannot solve the core problem the psychological `theory crisis' refers to, which are the currently high degrees of contrastive and holistic underdetermination of our theories by our data. I do so by first introducing underdetermination as an explanatory framework for determining the evidential import of research findings for theories, and showing how both broader theoretical considerations and informal assumptions are key to this process. Then, I derive the aforementioned core problem from the current `theory crisis' literature and tentatively explore its possible solutions. Lastly, I show that formal modelling is neither a necessary nor sufficient solution for either contrastive or holistic underdetermination, and that its uncritical adoption might instead worsen the crisis.},

  abstract = {Direct sampling of human skeletal muscle using the needle biopsy technique can facilitate insight into the biochemical and histological responses resulting from changes in exercise or feeding. However, the muscle biopsy procedure is invasive, and analyses are often expensive, which places pragmatic restraints on sample sizes. The unilateral exercise model can serve to increase statistical power and reduce the time and cost of a study. With this approach, 2 limbs of a participant are randomized to 1 of 2 treatments that can be applied almost concurrently or sequentially depending on the nature of the intervention. Similar to a typical repeated measures design, comparisons are made within participants, which increases statistical power by reducing the amount of between-person variability. A washout period is often unnecessary, reducing the time needed to complete the experiment and the influence of potential confounding variables such as habitual diet, activity, and sleep. Variations of the unilateral exercise model have been employed to investigate the influence of exercise, diet, and the interaction between the 2, on a wide range of variables including mitochondrial content, capillary density, and skeletal muscle hypertrophy. Like any model, unilateral exercise has some limitations: it cannot be used to study variables that potentially transfer across limbs, and it is generally limited to exercises that can be performed in pairs of treatments. Where appropriate, however, the unilateral exercise model can yield robust, well-controlled investigations of skeletal muscle responses to a wide range of interventions and conditions including exercise, dietary manipulation, and disuse or immobilization.},

This review synthesizes the evidence regarding the influence of asthma on PA and sedentary time and evaluates the role of key moderators for this relationship. In accordance with PRISMA guidelines, six electronic databases and gray literature were searched. Primary studies in English were included if they reported device-assessed PA in youth with and without asthma. Random effects meta-analyses examined the effect of asthma on PA and, separately, sedentary time. Mixed-effect meta-regression analyses were conducted using age and sex as moderators, with sub-group comparisons for study quality and asthma diagnosis criteria. Overall, of 3944 citations retrieved, 2850 were screened after the removal of supplication and 2743 citations excluded. Of the 107 full-text publications reviewed, 16 were included in data extraction and analysis, with 15 and five studies included in the PA and sedentary time meta-analyses, respectively. The robust effect size estimate for the influence of asthma on PA and sedentary time was -0.04 [95\% CI~=~-0.11, 0.03] and -0.09 [95\% CI~=~-0.12, -0.06], indicating a non-significant and significant trivial effect, respectively. The effect of asthma on PA levels or sedentary time was not associated with age or sex. Youth with controlled asthma are equally physically (in)active as their healthy peers, with asthma associated with less sedentary time. However, methodological limitations and a paucity of clear methodological reporting temper these conclusions. More rigorous device-based assessments, with a particular focus on sedentary time, and more robust diagnoses of asthma, especially with regard to severity, are needed.},

We compared triceps brachii hypertrophy after elbow extension training performed in the overhead vs. neutral arm position. Using a cable machine, 21 adults conducted elbow extensions (90-0{$^\circ$}) with one arm in the overhead (Overhead-Arm) and the other arm in the neutral (Neutral-Arm) position at 70\% one-repetition maximum (1RM), 10 reps/set, 5 sets/session, 2 sessions/week for 12 weeks. Training load was gradually increased (+5\% 1RM/session) when the preceding session was completed without repetition failure. 1RM of the assigned condition and MRI-measured muscle volume of the TBLong, monoarticular lateral and medial heads (TBLat+Med), and whole triceps brachii (Whole-TB) were assessed pre- and post-training. Training load and 1RM increased in both arms similarly (+62-71\% at post, P\,=\,0.285), while their absolute values/weights were always lower in Overhead-Arm (-34-39\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Changes in muscle volume in Overhead-Arm compared to Neutral-Arm were 1.5-fold greater for the TBLong (+28.5\% vs. +19.6\%, Cohen's d\,=\,0.61, P\,{$<$}\,0.001), 1.4-fold greater for the TBLat+Med (+14.6\% vs. +10.5\%, d\,=\,0.39, P\,=\,0.002), and 1.4-fold greater for the Whole-TB (+19.9\% vs. +13.9\%, d\,=\,0.54, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). In conclusion, triceps brachii hypertrophy was substantially greater after elbow extension training performed in the overhead versus neutral arm position, even with lower absolute loads used during the training.HighlightsGrowing evidence suggests that resistance training at long muscle lengths promotes muscle hypertrophy, but its practical applications are yet to be explored.Triceps brachii muscle hypertrophy was substantially greater after cable elbow extension training performed in the overhead than neutral arm position, particularly in the biarticular triceps brachii long head, even with lower absolute loads lifted (i.e. lower mechanical stress to muscles/joints).Cable elbow extension training should be performed in the overhead rather than neutral arm position if one aims to maximise muscle hypertrophy of the triceps brachii or to prevent atrophy of this muscle.},

To convincingly argue that dreams are only achievable through mind-numbing toil, the writer draws heavily from biographical, philosophical, economic, religious, historical and scientific data.Work is the mission; the multiple rewards are the byproducts, he argues. Moreover, the pleasure resides in the effort, not the results. Against the dark backdrop of malignancies inflicted on society by unrepentant leeches, the benefit of conscientious work is sharply focused. The reader is imperceptibly nudged into a higher plane of reality: namely, purposeful effort, regardless of its nature, is supremely rewarding. The writer forces the realization that regardless of the outcome, effort is never wasted. Conversely, indolence is the bane of progress and the root cause of economic crimes. Indeed, corruption in all its diabolical forms is nothing but laziness masquerading as diligence and embraced by vacuous minds craving the most for the least.Analysis of biographical data sustains the thesis that industry prolongs life; inaction truncates it -- a finding supported by the second Law of Thermodynamics. The persuasiveness of the arguments is supported by a wealth of references. Together they form the final authority; they have given resonance to the arguments contained herein.},

Oftentimes, strength-based athletes use AIs to postpone acute fatigue or increase arousal. Despite the widespread use of AIs, the amount of research examining its physiological effects, efficacy, and safety is low compared with other ergogenic aids that have been extensively researched. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to provide sports science researchers, strength and conditioning professionals, medical professionals, and other practitioners with the most up to date information about the benefits, risks, and physiological effects of AIs. To date, there is a lack of evidence to support anecdotal claims of increased cognitive arousal and greater strength performance. However, there may be a short-term effect of AIs on the cardiorespiratory system (possibly increasing breathing rate and heart rate approximately 15--30 seconds), but further research is needed to support these findings and to determine how the short-term cardiorespiratory effects may affect other physiological and performance measures. Finally, although evidence does not indicate that AIs are dangerous in healthy populations, sport and health professionals should be aware of the potential risks of AIs to prevent any unlikely, but possible, difficulties.},

This study evaluated the influence of personality traits (behavioral activation system; BAS and behavioral inhibition system; BIS) and self-efficacy on affect, enjoyment and perceived exertion during HIIE in adolescents. Participants (n = 30; 15 boys; mean age = 12.2 \textpm{} 0.4 years; moderate to vigorous physical activity levels per day = 33 \textpm{} 12 min) were median split into low vs. high BAS/BIS and self-efficacy groups. All participants performed HIIE consisting of 8 \texttimes{} 1-min work-intervals at 85\% of peak power separated by 75 s recovery. Affect, enjoyment, and rating of perceived exertion (RPE) were recorded 5 min before HIIE, near the end of the HIIE work intervals, and 20 min after HIIE. The high BAS/low BIS group elicited greater affect and enjoyment compared to low BAS/high BIS group during work-intervals 5--8 (all p {$<$} 0.039, all ES {$>$} 0.59) and after HIIE for post-enjoyment (all p {$<$} 0.038, all ES {$>$} 0.95).

Yet, despite their importance, anchoring procedures remain understudied and theoretically underdeveloped. Here we propose a new task-based anchoring procedure that distinguishes between imposed and self-selected anchors. In the former, researchers impose on participants a specific task as the anchor; in the latter, participants choose the most effortful task experienced or imaginable as the anchor. We compared the impact of these conceptually different anchoring procedures on RPE. Methods Twenty-five resistance-trained participants (13 females) attended a familiarization and two randomized experimental sessions. In both experimental sessions, participants performed non-fatiguing and fatiguing isometric maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) protocols with the squat followed by the gripper or vice versa. After each MVC, participants reported their RPE on a 0--10 scale relative to an imposed anchor of the performed task (e.g., gripper MVCs anchored to a gripper MVC) or to a self-selected anchor. Results In the non-fatiguing condition, imposed anchors yielded greater RPEs than self-selected anchors for both the squat [on average, 9.4 vs. 5.5; {$\Delta$}(CI95\%)~=~3.9 (3.2, 4.5)] and gripper [9.4 vs. 3.9; {$\Delta~$}=~5.5 (4.7, 6.3)]. Similar results were observed in the fatiguing condition for both the squat [9.7 vs. 6.9; {$\Delta~$}=~2.8 (2.1, 3.5)] and gripper [9.7 vs. 4.5; {$\Delta~$}=~5.2 (4.3, 5.9)]. Conclusions We found large differences in RPE between the two anchors, independent of exercises and fatigue state.

Yet overweight/obesity remains the focus in public health policy. Surveillance of body mass index (BMI) and CRF considering school deprivation levels is limited. Therefore, we examined this in English primary schools. METHODS: Participants (n=409) were students (9-10 years) from 13 schools. BMI and CRF (20\,m shuttle run) were measured at three time points across the academic year and a fourth after summer recess. RESULTS: BMI z-scores significantly decreased (p=0.015) from autumn (z=0.336 (95\% CI 0.212 to 0.460)) to spring (z=0.252 (95\% CI 0.132 to 0.371)), and then significantly increased (p=0.010) to summer (z=0.327 (95\% CI 0.207 to 0.447)). CRF significantly increased (p{$<$}0.001) from autumn (z=0.091 (95\% CI -0.014 to 0.196)) to spring (z=0.492 (95\% CI 0.367 to 0.616)), no change (p=0.308) into summer (z=0.411 (95\% CI 0.294 to 0.528)) and a significant decrease (p{$<$}0.001) into the following autumn term (z=0.125 (95\% CI 0.021 to 0.230)). BMI was unaffected by deprivation; however, pupils from the most deprived areas saw significantly greater reductions in CRF compared with pupils from affluent areas. No time, or deprivation level, by sex interactions were found. CONCLUSION: Significant reductions in children's CRF occurred over the summer recess and were greater among children from schools in the most deprived areas. This may help inform future research into interventions targeting physical activity of schoolchildren, particularly over the summer recess.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many sedentary adults have high body fat along with low fitness, strength, and lean body mass (LBM) which are associated with poor health independently of body mass. Physical activity can aid in prevention, management, and treatment of numerous chronic conditions. The potential efficacy of resistance training (RT) in modifying risk factors for cardiovascular and metabolic disease is clear. However, RT is under researched in public health. We report community-based studies of RT in sedentary (Study 1), and overweight and pre-diabetic (Study 2) populations. METHODS: Study 1~- A semi randomised trial design (48-weeks): Participants choosing either a fitness centre approach, and randomised to structured-exercise (STRUC, n\,=\,107), or free/unstructured gym use (FREE, n\,=\,110), or not, and randomised to physical-activity-counselling (PAC, n\,=\,71) or a measurement only comparator (CONT, n\,=\,76). Study 2~- A randomised wait list controlled trial (12-weeks): Patients were randomly assigned to; traditional-supervised-exercise (STRUC, n\,=\,30), physical-activity-counselling (PAC, n\,=\,23), either combined (COMB, n\,=\,39), or a wait-list comparator (CONT, n\,=\,54). Outcomes for both were BF mass (kg), LBM (kg), BF percentage (\%), and strength. RESULTS: Study 1: One-way ANCOVA revealed significant between group effects for BF\% and LBM, but not for BF mass or strength. Post hoc paired comparisons revealed significantly greater change in LBM for the STRUC group compared with the CONT group. Within group changes using 95\%CIs revealed significant changes only in the STRUC group for both BF\% (-\,4.1 to -\,0.9\%) and LBM (0.1 to 4.5~kg), and in FREE (8.2 to 28.5~kg) and STRUC (5.9 to 26.0~kg) for strength. Study 2: One-way ANCOVA did not reveal significant between group effects for strength, BF\%, BF mass, or LBM. For strength, 95\%CIs revealed significant within group changes for the STRUC (2.4 to 14.1~kg) and COMB (3.7 to 15.0~kg) groups. CONCLUSION: Strength increased in both studies across all RT treatments compared to controls, yet significant improvements in both strength and body-composition occurred only in programmed and/or supervised RT. As general increases in physical activity have limited impact upon body-composition, public health practitioners should structure interventions to include progressive RT.

However, evidence for media effects are inconsistent in the literature. This study investigated this "lift big-get big" culture and effects of imagery on males' beliefs regarding RT. Method: An online survey was conducted with male participants (N~=~110) randomized to different images (hyper-muscular/lean/control) and RT information ("lift big-get big"/"evidence based RT"/control). Results: Descriptive data suggested belief in necessity of heavy loads and free weights was pervasive. There was a small significant effect of condition for multivariate analysis of beliefs regarding RT. Univariate analyses showed significant effects of condition regarding the importance of free weights and heavy loads for strength, and free weights for hypertrophy. Small to moderate effects were found comparing "evidence-based RT" with a hyper-muscular physique to "lift big-get big" conditions with both hyper-muscular and lean physiques, the latter more likely to agree free weights and heavy loads are necessary for strength. A small effect was found comparing "lift big-get big" conditions with both hyper-muscular and lean physiques and the control condition, the former more likely to agree free weights are necessary for hypertrophy. Conclusions: Although hyper-muscular bodies alone did not influence RT beliefs, new information, i.e., "evidence-based RT" combined with a hyper-muscular physique had a small effect. The "lift big-get big" culture is perhaps pervasive enough that most conditions merely reinforced existing beliefs.},

  abstract = {Hamstring strain injuries during sprinting or stretching frequently occur at long-muscle length. Yet, previous research has mainly focused on studying the effectiveness of eccentric hamstring strengthening at shorter muscle length on hamstring performance, morphology, and hamstring strain injury risk factors. Here, we evaluated the effects of 6-week eccentric hamstring training at long-muscle length on functional and architectural characteristics of the hamstrings. Healthy and injury-free participants (n = 40; age 23.7 \textpm{} 2.5 years) were randomly assigned to control or intervention group. Training intervention consisted of 12 sessions with two eccentric hamstring exercises in a lengthened position. Outcome measures included isokinetic and isometric knee flexion peak torque, Nordic hamstring exercise peak torque, voluntary activation level, and countermovement jump performance. Ultrasonography was used to determine muscle thickness, pennation angle, and fascicle length of biceps femoris long head (BFlh). A significant time \texttimes{} group interaction effect was observed for all measured parameters except countermovement jump performance and muscle thickness. The training intervention resulted in increased concentric and eccentric knee flexion peak torque at 60{$^\circ$}/s ( d  = 0.55-0.62, P  = .02 and .03) and concentric peak torque at 180{$^\circ$}/s ( d  = 0.99, P  = .001), increased isometric knee flexion peak torque ( d  = 0.73, P  = .008) and Nordic hamstring exercise peak torque ( d  = 1.19, P  {$<$} .001), increased voluntary activation level ( d  = 1.29, P  {$<$} .001), decreased pennation angle ( d  = 1.31, P  {$<$} .001), and increased fascicle length ( d  = 1.12, P  {$<$} .001) of BFlh. These results provide evidence that short-term eccentric hamstring strengthening at long-muscle length can have significant favorable effects on various architectural and functional characteristics of the hamstrings.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is currently limited evidence available to support the use of the isometric mid-thigh pull (IMTP) within professional soccer. The aim of this study was to analyze the association between IMTP variables, with common markers of athletic performance capability. METHODS: Eleven professional development soccer players (age: 20\textpm 2 years, stature: 1.82\textpm 0.10 m, mass: 76.4\textpm 12.8 kg) performed IMTP, 5 m and 10 m accelerations, maximal sprint speed (MSS), countermovement jump (CMJ), and the 505 change of direction test (COD). RESULTS: Relative and absolute peak force (PF) and force at 50, 100, 150 and 200 ms values were measured during the IMTP. Relative F150, F200, PF displayed large to very large correlations with MSS (r=0.51, r=0.66, and r=0.76 respectively), while absolute PF also displayed a large correlation with MSS (r=0.57). Relative and absolute PF showed large correlations with CMJ height (r=0.54 and r=0.55 respectively). Relative F150 and F200 highlighted large correlations with COD ability (r=-0.68 and r=-0.60 respectively). Relative F200 and PF had a large negative correlation with 10 m acceleration (r=-0.55 and r=-0.53 respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This study provides an important contribution to knowledge within the area of IMTP testing in professional soccer by evidencing the prominence of the isometric force generating capacity as an underpinning factor in relation to athletic capability.},

In this article, we aim to review current statistical approaches typically used by exercise physiologists and sport scientists for the design and analysis of experimental interventions and to highlight the importance of including equivalence and non-inferiority studies, which address different research questions from deciding whether an effect is present. Initially, we briefly describe the most common approaches, along with their rationale, to investigate the effects of different interventions. We then discuss the main steps involved in the design and analysis of equivalence and non-inferiority studies, commonly performed in other research fields, with worked examples from exercise physiology and sport science scenarios. Finally, we provide recommendations to exercise physiologists and sport scientists who would like to apply the different approaches in future research. We hope this work will promote the correct use of equivalence and non-inferiority designs in exercise physiology and sport science whenever the research context, conditions, applications, researchers' interests or reasonable beliefs justify these approaches.},

Perceptions of efficacy were assessed prior to and following exercise testing while perceptions of effort expenditure and in-task affect were assessed at 70\% of predicted maxim heart rate. Highly efficacious subjects had lower perceptions of effort expenditure and reported more positive affect during exercise than did their less efficacious counterparts. Affective responses during exercise were in turn significant predictors of posttest self-efficacy.

Study Design and Setting This systematic review summarizes and evaluates the strength of available evidence on the Hawthorne effect. An inclusive definition of any form of research artifact on behavior using this label, and without cointerventions, was adopted. Results Nineteen purposively designed studies were included, providing quantitative data on the size of the effect in eight randomized controlled trials, five quasiexperimental studies, and six observational evaluations of reporting on one's behavior by answering questions or being directly observed and being aware of being studied. Although all but one study was undertaken within health sciences, study methods, contexts, and findings were highly heterogeneous. Most studies reported some evidence of an effect, although significant biases are judged likely because of the complexity of the evaluation object. Conclusion Consequences of research participation for behaviors being investigated do exist, although little can be securely known about the conditions under which they operate, their mechanisms of effects, or their magnitudes. New concepts are needed to guide empirical studies.},

A theoretical approach using forward-dynamics simulation allows individual parameters to be systematically perturbed independently of potentially confounding variables. Each study typically follows a four-stage process of model construction, parameter determination, model evaluation, and model optimization. This review critically evaluates forward-dynamics simulation models of maximal effort sporting movements using a dynamical systems theory framework. Organismic, environmental, and task constraints applied within such models are critically evaluated, and recommendations are made regarding future directions and best practices. The incorporation of self-organizational processes representing movement variability and ``intrinsic dynamics'' remains limited. In the future, forward-dynamics simulation models predicting individual-specific optimal techniques of sporting movements may be used as indicative rather than prescriptive tools within a coaching framework to aid applied practice and understanding, although researchers and practitioners should continue to consider concerns resulting from dynamical systems theory regarding the complexity of models and particularly regarding self-organization processes.},

Currently, there is no common perspective or terminology to characterize the caliber and training status of an individual or cohort. This paper presents a 6-tiered Participant Classification Framework whereby all individuals across a spectrum of exercise backgrounds and athletic abilities can be classified. The Participant Classification Framework uses training volume and performance metrics to classify a participant to one of the following: Tier 0: Sedentary; Tier 1: Recreationally Active; Tier 2: Trained/Developmental; Tier 3: Highly Trained/National Level; Tier 4: Elite/International Level; or Tier 5: World Class. We suggest the Participant Classification Framework can be used to classify participants both prospectively (as part of study participant recruitment) and retrospectively (during systematic reviews and/or meta-analyses). Discussion around how the Participant Classification Framework can be tailored toward different sports, athletes, and/or events has occurred, and sport-specific examples provided. Additional nuances such as depth of sport participation, nationality differences, and gender parity within a sport are all discussed. Finally, chronological age with reference to the junior and masters athlete, as well as the Paralympic athlete, and their inclusion within the Participant Classification Framework has also been considered. It is our intention that this framework be widely implemented to systematically classify participants in research featuring exercise, sport, performance, health, and/or fitness outcomes going forward, providing the much-needed uniformity to classification practices.},

Methods: Participants trained for 8 weeks, loading the quadriceps in a shortened (SL, 0--50{$<$} knee flexion; n 5 10) or lengthened (LL, 40--90{$<$}; n 5 11) position, followed by 4 weeks of detraining. Controls (CON; n 5 10) were untrained. Quadriceps strength, vastus lateralis architecture, anatomical cross-sectional area (aCSA), and serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) were measured at weeks 0, 8, 10, and 12. Results: Increases in fascicle length (29 6 4\% vs. 14 6 4\%), distal aCSA (53 6 12\% vs. 18 6 8\%), strength (26 6 6\% vs. 7 6 3\%), and IGF-1 (31 6 6\% vs. 7 6 6\%) were greater in LL compared with SL muscles (P {$<$} 0.05). No changes occurred in CON. Detraining decrements in strength and aCSA were greater in SL than LL muscles (P {$<$} 0.05). Conclusions: Enhanced muscle in vivo (and somewhat IGF-1) adaptations to resistance training are concurrent with muscle stretch, which warrants its inclusion within training.},

  abstract = {Purpose There has not been a recent comprehensive effort to examine existing studies on the resting metabolic rate (RMR) of adults to identify the effect of common population demographic and anthropometric characteristics. Thus, we reviewed the literature on RMR (kcal{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}h-1) to determine the relationship of age, sex, and obesity status to RMR as compared with the commonly accepted value for the metabolic equivalent (MET; e.g., 1.0 kcal{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}h-1). Methods Using several databases, scientific articles published from 1980 to 2011 were identified that measured RMR, and from those, others dating back to 1920 were identified. One hundred and ninety-seven studies were identified, resulting in 397 publication estimates of RMR that could represent a population subgroup. Inverse variance weighting technique was applied to compute means and 95\% confidence intervals (CI). Results The mean value for RMR was 0.863 kcal{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}h-1 (95\% CI = 0.852--0.874), higher for men than women, decreasing with increasing age, and less in overweight than normal weight adults. Regardless of sex, adults with BMI {$\geq$} 30 kg{$\cdot$}m-2 had the lowest RMR ({$<$}0.741 kcal{$\cdot$}kg-1{$\cdot$}h-1). Conclusions No single value for RMR is appropriate for all adults. Adhering to the nearly universally accepted MET convention may lead to the overestimation of the RMR of approximately 10\%for men and almost 15\% for women and be as high as 20\%--30\% for some demographic and anthropometric combinations. These large errors raise questions about the longstanding adherence to the conventional MET value for RMR. Failure to recognize this discrepancy may result in important miscalculations of energy expended from interventions using physical activity for diabetes and other chronic disease prevention efforts.},

  abstract = {We discuss problems the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) paradigm poses for replication and more broadly in the biomedical and social sciences as well as how these problems remain unresolved by proposals involving modified p-value thresholds, confidence intervals, and Bayes factors. We then discuss our own proposal, which is to abandon statistical significance. We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm---and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it---as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to ``ban'' p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can be implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical decision making more broadly.},

The writings of philosophers, including their disagreements, are often helpful in such circumstances. Whether knowledge of formal metatheory helps us in doing ``normal science'' is researchable. Much scientific thinking is of poor quality, and it could be improved by explicit metatheoretical education. Clinical practice and training programs should emphasize rational skepticism, respect for evidence, objectivity, and quantitative thinking. Because the relation between principles and success is probabilistic, metatheoretical research should implement the case study method by formal actuarial procedures.},

Even though intrinsic subject matter difficulties (20 are listed) contribute to this, the excessive reliance on significance testing is partly responsible (Ronald A. Fisher). Karl Popper's approach, with modifications, would be prophylactic. Since the null hypothesis is quasi-always false, tables summarizing research in terms of patterns of "significant differences" are little more than complex, causally uninterpretable outcomes of statistical power functions. Multiple paths to estimating numerical point values ("consistency tests") are better, even if approximate with rough tolerances; and lacking this, ranges, orderings, 2nd-order differences, curve peaks and valleys, and function forms should be used. Such methods are usual in developed sciences that seldom report statistical significance. Consistency tests of a conjectural taxometric model yielded 94\% success with no false negatives.

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to analyse the effects that long-term progressive resistance training interventions performed on weight machines have on sarcopenia (European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People) and how the interventions are composed. In total, 779 articles published between 2000 and 2020 were scanned (PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL) and 14 randomised controlled trials were included within the review. Populations, interventions, control groups and outcomes were analysed. Subsequent meta-analysis (10 studies, 902 participants) revealed that the time needed in a chair-stand-test, as an indicator for leg strength, was predominantly reduced, whereas grip strength remained unchanged after the interventions. Data concerning the effects of machine-based progressive resistance training on muscle quantity were insufficient for meta-analysis. Physical performance measured by undergoing the Timed-Up-and-Go-test, gait speed test, Short Physical Performance Battery and 6~min-walk-test improved significantly as well. The quality of evidence (GRADE) in the analysed studies was low or moderate. In summary, machine-based progressive resistance training has the potential to reverse sarcopenia in the oldest old, as reflected by enhanced muscle strength and physical performance. The systematic review revealed promising initial results for muscle quantity.},

In a larger sample of 174 studies, we also examined a) the usage, reporting practices and reproducibility of a-priori power analyses; and b) the prevalence of reporting practices of t-statistic or F-ratio, degrees of freedom, exact p-values, effect sizes and confidence intervals. Our results indicate that there was some indication of publication bias and the average observed power was low (53\% for significant and non-significant findings and 61\% for only significant findings). Finally, the usage and reporting practices of a-priori power analyses as well as statistical results including test statistics, effect sizes and confidence intervals were suboptimal.},

  abstract = {Continuity is usually assumed as a defining feature of measured quantities. This premise is false for counted quantities, amount of substance, electric charge, and others that are constrained to exist in integral multiples of a quantum. A software application that treats these quantities as continuous can predict outcomes that are physically impossible, such as the production of half a photon. Thus far, formalizations of quantity calculus have not addressed how quantities that are structured like the integers should interoperate with continuous quantities. This article introduces the extension of quantity calculus to include quantal quantities, which vary in steps rather than continuously, and discusses the consequences of including them. Savage's foundation of expected utility is considered to be the most convincing justification of Bayesian expected utility and the crowning glory of decision theory. It combines exceptionally appealing axioms with deep mathematics. Despite the wide influence and deep respect that Savage received in economics and statistics, virtually no one touched his mathematical tools. We provide an updated analysis that is more general and more accessible. Our derivations are self-contained. This helps to better appreciate the depth and beauty of Savage's work and the foundations of Bayesianism, to teach it more easily, and to develop non-Bayesian generalizations incorporating ambiguity more efficiently. This paper studies a balance whose unobservable fulcrum is not necessarily located at the middle of its two pans. It presents three different models, showing how this lack of symmetry modifies the observation, the formalism and the interpretation of such a biased measuring device. It argues that the biased balance can be an interesting source of inspiration for our abstract understanding of how a measuring device influences the measurement process. Although measurement has been an important component of human activities for millennia, it remains remarkably difficult to provide a fully satisfactory definition of the concept. In part this is due to the fact that measurement is a diverse and dynamic human activity, and takes shape in a wide variety of ways depending on the nature of the subject matter, application, and context. If a definition of measurement is to pay respect to this basic fact, it cannot be so narrowly construed as to apply to only one area of scientific activity (e.g., physics); on the other hand, the definition cannot be so permissive as to trivialize the concept to the point that measurement is not recognizably superior to, for instance, guesses or statements of opinion. One issue at the heart of this tension is the relationship between the concepts of measurement, quantity, and quantification. In particular, it is sometimes argued or assumed either that quantification is a necessary condition for measurement, or that quantification is simply synonymous with measurement. To assess the validity of these positions, the concepts of measurement, quantity, and quantification should be independently defined and their relationships analyzed. In this paper we conduct such an analysis, from both historical and philosophical perspectives, and present the case that quantification is neither necessary nor sufficient for measurement. We conclude by considering how the conceptual separation of measurement and quantification serves to promote more productive and shared understandings of measurement across disciplines. It has been known since the work of Duskin and Pelletier four decades ago that Kop{$<$}math{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi mathvariant="sans-serif" is="true"{$>$}K{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi mathvariant="normal" is="true"{$>$}op{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}/math{$>$}, the opposite of the category of compact Hausdorff spaces and continuous maps, is monadic over the category of sets. It follows that Kop{$<$}math{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi mathvariant="sans-serif" is="true"{$>$}K{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi mathvariant="normal" is="true"{$>$}op{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}/math{$>$} is equivalent to a possibly infinitary variety of algebras {$\Delta$} in the sense of S\l omi\'nski and Linton. Isbell showed in 1982 that the Lawvere--Linton algebraic theory of {$\Delta$} can be generated using a finite number of finitary operations, together with a single operation of countably infinite arity. In 1983, Banaschewski and Rosick\'y independently proved a conjecture of Bankston, establishing a strong negative result on the axiomatisability of Kop{$<$}math{$><$}msup is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi mathvariant="sans-serif" is="true"{$>$}K{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi mathvariant="normal" is="true"{$>$}op{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msup{$><$}/math{$>$}. In particular, {$\Delta$} is not a finitary variety -- Isbell's result is best possible. The problem of axiomatising {$\Delta$} by equations has remained open. Using the theory of Chang's MV-algebras as a key tool, along with Isbell's fundamental insight on the semantic nature of the infinitary operation, we provide a finite axiomatisation of {$\Delta$}. This is a paper on the foundations of individual rational choice, specifically on the foundations of consumer theory. Neoclassical consumer theory requires that the behavior of the consumer be explained by means of a preference relation, and that all the required properties of the corresponding utility representation be derived from the properties of this relation. Yet, it is not clear what is the meaning of the property of the preference relation required in order to show that it is representable by means of a continuously differentiable C1 utility function. The aim of the present paper is to propose an explanation of such property and to prove the existence of a C1 representation. Este es un art\'iculo sobre los fundamentos de la teor\'ia de la elecci\'on racional individual, espec\'ificamente sobre los fundamentos de la teor\'ia del consumidor. La teor\'ia neocl\'asica del consumidor requiere que el comportamiento del consumidor sea explicado mediante una relaci\'on de preferencia y que todas las propiedades requeridas de la correspondiente funci\'on de utilidad que la represente sean derivadas de las propiedades de esta relaci\'on. No obstante, no est\'a claro cu\'al es el significado de la propiedad de la relaci\'on de preferencia requerida para mostrar que la misma es representable mediante una funci\'on continuamente diferenciable (C1). El prop\'osito del presente art\'iculo es proponer una explicaci\'on de tal propiedad y demostrar la existencia de una representaci\'on. In Thas (2014) it was explained how one can naturally associate a Deitmar scheme (which is a scheme defined over the field with one element, F1{$<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi mathvariant="double-struck" is="true"{$>$}F{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}1{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$}) to a so-called ``loose graph'' (which is a generalization of a graph). Several properties of the Deitmar scheme can be proven easily from the combinatorics of the (loose) graph, and known realizations of objects over F1{$<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi mathvariant="double-struck" is="true"{$>$}F{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}1{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} such as combinatorial F1{$<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi mathvariant="double-struck" is="true"{$>$}F{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}1{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$}-projective and F1{$<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi mathvariant="double-struck" is="true"{$>$}F{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}1{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$}-affine spaces exactly depict the loose graph which corresponds to the associated Deitmar scheme. In this paper, we first modify the construction of loc. cit., and show that Deitmar schemes which are defined by finite trees (with possible end points) are ``defined over F1{$<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi mathvariant="double-struck" is="true"{$>$}F{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}1{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$}'' in Kurokawa's sense; we then derive a precise formula for the Kurokawa zeta function for such schemes (and so also for the counting polynomial of all associated Fq{$<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi mathvariant="double-struck" is="true"{$>$}F{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi is="true"{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$}-schemes). As a corollary, we find a zeta function for all such trees which contains information such as the number of inner points and the spectrum of degrees, and which is thus very different than Ihara's zeta function (which is trivial in this case). Using a process called ``surgery,'' we show that one can determine the zeta function of a general loose graph and its associated \textbraceleft Deitmar, Grothendieck\textbraceright -schemes in a number of steps, eventually reducing the calculation essentially to trees. We study a number of classes of examples of loose graphs, and introduce the Grothendieck ring of F1{$<$}math{$><$}msub is="true"{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mi mathvariant="double-struck" is="true"{$>$}F{$<$}/mi{$><$}/mrow{$><$}mrow is="true"{$><$}mn is="true"{$>$}1{$<$}/mn{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$}-schemes along the way in order to perform the calculations. Finally, we include a computer program for performing more tedious calculations, and compare the new zeta function to Ihara's zeta function for graphs in a number of examples. In both scientific and lay settings, measurement is considered a privileged source of high-quality information, and is commonly associated with precision, accuracy, and dependability. However, it is not always clear what features of the measurement process justify this public trust, and how the quality of measurement results in different domains of inquiry can be compared. In this paper, we first argue that the quality of measurement results depends on their object-relatedness (``objectivity'') and subject-independence (``intersubjectivity'') and is justified on the basis of the structural features of the measurement process, as well as features of the inputs or the outputs of the process. Given this perspective, we analyze three general measurement methods, according to which a measurement process can be structured and performed, which may be called (a) direct synchronous, (b) direct asynchronous, and (c) indirect. In addition to the value of these distinctions for the process of designing measuring instruments, they allow us to highlight the different roles of models, theories, and computations in measurement. We then attempt to apply this classification strategy in the context of the social sciences by discussing the role of (1) the definition of the measurand and (2) the theory connecting the measurand to the measurement results in each of these measurement methods, and how they can or cannot be conceptualized from the perspective of measurement theories in the social sciences. This leads us to the conclusion that the differences between physical and non-physical measurement are historical and contextual rather than essential; that is, in both cases, the quality of measurement results can be effectively evaluated from a structural perspective. I argue that instead of a rather narrow focus on N. Bohr's account of complementarity as a particular and perhaps obscure metaphysical or epistemological concept (or as being motivated by such a concept), we should consider it to result from pursuing a particular method of studying physical phenomena. More precisely, I identify a strong undercurrent of Baconian method of induction in Bohr's work that likely emerged during his experimental training and practice. When its development is analyzed in light of Baconian induction, complementarity emerges as a levelheaded rather than a controversial account, carefully elicited from a comprehensive grasp of the available experimental basis, shunning hasty metaphysically motivated generalizations based on partial experimental evidence. In fact, Bohr's insistence on the ``classical'' nature of observations in experiments, as well as the counterintuitive synthesis of wave and particle concepts that have puzzled scholars, seem a natural outcome (an updated instance) of the inductive method. Such analysis clarifies the intricacies of early Schr\"odinger's critique of the account as well as Bohr's response, which have been misinterpreted in the literature. If adequate, the analysis may lend considerable support to the view that Bacon explicated the general terms of an experimentally minded strand of the scientific method, developed and refined by scientists in the following three centuries. In the last few decades foundations of measurement have developed so as to account for both the role of modeling in measurement, in particular relating to the presence and the effects of measurement uncertainty, and the fact that any measurement is performed by using instruments that work on the basis of transduction effects and provide justified results only in so far as they are properly calibrated. This has triggered a new interest about the role of instruments in the models of measurement. The structure of the process has been variously studied in reference to the connection between measured properties and indications provided by instruments, and to the way in which intersubjective information on the measurand is acquired through instrument calibration. From such a background this paper proposes a comprehensive structural model of direct measurement, whose functional elements, empirical and informational, are presented with a bottom-up strategy as a set of interrelated modules. The result, shown to be a generalization of some of the models currently available in the literature of measurement science, highlights the key role of scales for measurement, clarifies the conceptual and operative relations between direct measurement and calibration, and identifies the principal sources of measurement uncertainty in the structural context of the process. This model is intended to interpret both physical and non-physical measurements, and as such it is a component of a ``measurement across the sciences'' research programme. Generalized counting constraint satisfaction problems include Holant problems with planarity restrictions; polynomial-time algorithms for such problems include matchgates and matchcircuits, which are based on Pfaffians. In particular, they use gates which are expressible in terms of a vector of sub-Pfaffians of a skew-symmetric matrix. We introduce a new type of circuit based instead on determinants, with seemingly different expressive power. In these determinantal circuits, a gate is represented by the vector of all minors of an arbitrary matrix. Determinantal circuits permit a different class of gates. Applications of these circuits include proofs of theorems from algebraic graph theory including the Chung--Langlands formula for the number of rooted spanning forests of a graph and computing Tutte polynomials of certain matroids. They also give a strategy for simulating quantum circuits with closed timelike curves. Monoidal category theory provides a useful language for discussing such counting problems, turning combinatorial restrictions into categorical properties. We introduce the counting problem in monoidal categories and count-preserving functors as a way to study FP{$<$}math{$><$}mi mathvariant="sans-serif" is="true"{$>$}FP{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$} subclasses of problems in settings which are generally \#P{$<$}math{$><$}mi mathvariant="normal" is="true"{$>\#<$}/mi{$><$}mi mathvariant="sans-serif" is="true"{$>$}P{$<$}/mi{$><$}/math{$>$}-hard. Using this machinery we show that, surprisingly, determinantal circuits can be simulated by Pfaffian circuits at quadratic cost. We suggest a normative model for the evaluation of explanations B because A based on probabilistic conditional reasoning and compare it with empirical data. According to the modus ponens model of explanations, the probability of B because A should equal the joint probability of the conditional if A then B and the explanans A. We argue that B because A expresses the conjunction of A and B as well as positive relevance of A for B. In Study 1, participants (N = 80) judged the subjective probabilities of 20 sets of statements with a focus on belief-based reasoning under uncertainty. In Study 2, participants (N = 376) were assigned to one of six item sets for which we varied the inferential relevance of A for B to explore boundary conditions of our model. We assessed the performance of our model across a range of analyses and report results on the Equation, a fundamental model in research on probabilistic reasoning concerning the evaluation of conditionals. In both studies, results indicate that participants' belief in statements B because A followed model predictions systematically. However, a sizeable proportion of sets of beliefs contained at least one incoherence, indicating deviations from the norms of rationality suggested by our model. In addition, results of Study 2 lend support to the idea that inferential relevance may be relevant for the evaluation of both conditionals and explanations.},

  abstract = {Unlike Andrew Kyngdon, I think the issue he has addressed is most informatively considered outside the confines of the representational theory of measurement. Then it becomes clear that while the theory of conjoint measurement is about situations like that treated by the Rasch model, the former isolates a different feature of those situations to the latter. But, if the relevant attributes are already presumed to be quantitative, the perceived differences are minimized and the Rasch model might seem to be a version of conjoint measurement. It is on this basis that Rasch modellers pursue their paradoxical quest for measurement. However, because the relevant attributes are not actually known to be quantitative, use of the Rasch model to measure psychological attributes remains logically dependent upon the outcome of research involving the theory of conjoint measurement or something very similar.},

Psychologists think that theorising in the area of psychological testing involves conjuring constructs, which are operationally defined and measured via psychometric tests. However, the `construct' concept is unworkable and laden with confused philosophical baggage accrued under the hegemony of logical empiricism, and its real function in psychology is obscured. Via an analysis of its history and logic, I expose its flawed conception of the relation between theoretical and observable concepts and the way in which it serves the myth of mental measurement. Finally, it is shown how the actual logic of theorising in science, which entails that theories are best inferred from relevant phenomena, not imaginatively constructed, oppugns this myth and promises to coordinate theoretical concepts with the phenomena to be explained.},

Franz (2022) concludes that psychological measurement does not rest on empirical hypotheses but rather on linguistic deceptions. His major premise is that psychometrics is inherently Cartesian. History shows otherwise: the mantras of operationism and the rituals of construct validity were intended to exorcise psyche from psychometrics. These mainstays of psychometrics ensured that theoretical constructs were more frequently dispositional concepts than they were mental concepts. It is with the latter, however, especially with attempts to measure currently occurring mental states, such as anxiety, that Franz?s argument looks more promising, but nevertheless it fails because it rests upon Wittgenstein?s views about the grammar of mental discourse. I conclude that conceptual analysis, realistically construed and applied to mental concepts, may show that they exclude quantitative structure. Despite that, it is always possible that empirical research might elicit quantitative-friendly revisions of mental concepts.},

Measurement is defined as the estimation of numerical relations (or ratios) between magnitudes of a quantitative attribute and a unit. The history of scientific measurement, from antiquity to the present may be interpreted as revealing a progressive deepening in the understanding of this position. First, the concept of ratio was broadened to include ratios between incommensurable magnitudes; second, the concept of a quantitative attribute was broadened to include non-extensive quantities; third, quantitative structure and its relations to ratios and real numbers were elaborated; and finally, the issue of empirically distinguishing between quantitative and non-quantitative structures was addressed. This interpretation of measurement understands it in a way that is continuous with scientific investigation in general, i.e., as an attempt to discover independently existing facts.},

It is shown that with a weak order upon 3 \texttimes{} 3 matrices both independence and a single test of double cancellation (which is logically independent of independence) are necessary and sufficient for additivity.

Most of the founders of the discipline committed it and it makes sense of otherwise anomalous developments within the discipline, such as the permissible statistics controversy and the dominant form taken by item response theories. The fallacy is displayed by showing (1) that an attribute's quantitative structure reduces to a weak order upon differences between degrees that satisfies the double cancellation, solvability, and Archimedean conditions of conjoint measurement theory and (2) the fact that any order on the degrees themselves does not entail sufficient structure on this weak order to guarantee satisfaction of these conditions. Thus, it is possible that an ordered attribute is non-quantitative. Also, each pair of differences between degrees of an ordinal attribute falls into one of two disjoint classes: (1) those where the order relation between the pair follows from an order on the attribute and (2) those where it is independent of that order and possibly diagnostic of quantitative structure and this fact means that the distinction between order and quantity is an empirical one.},

Normal-weight (n = 264) and obese (n = 234) individuals were studied and REE was measured by indirect calorimetry.

Simplification of this formula and separation by sex did not affect its predictive value: REE (males) = 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) - 5 x age (y) + 5; REE (females) = 10 x weight (kg) + 6.25 x height (cm) - 5 x age (y) - 161.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with continuous outcomes usually only examine mean differences in response between trial arms. If the intervention has heterogeneous effects, then outcome variances will also differ between arms. Power of an individual trial to assess heterogeneity is lower than the power to detect the same size of main effect. METHODS: We describe several methods for assessing differences in variance in trial arms and apply them to a single trial with individual patient data and to meta-analyses using summary data. Where individual data are available, we use regression-based methods to examine the effects of covariates on variation. We present an additional method to meta-analyze differences in variances with summary data. RESULTS: In the single trial, there was agreement between methods, and the difference in variance was largely due to differences in prevalence of depression at baseline. In two meta-analyses, most individual trials did not show strong evidence of a difference in variance between arms, with wide confidence intervals. However, both meta-analyses showed evidence of greater variance in the control arm, and in one example, this was perhaps because mean outcome in the control arm was higher. CONCLUSIONS: Using meta-analysis, we overcame low power of individual trials to examine differences in variance using meta-analysis. Evidence of differences in variance should be followed up to identify potential effect modifiers and explore other possible causes such as varying compliance.},

Two additional studies used the Academic Diligence Task (Galla et al., 2014), where high school students (N = 447 and N = 884) could toggle between a math task and playing a video game/watching videos. In these studies, we again find that math interest relates to greater proportion of time spent on the math problems. Three of these four studies also examined perceived fatigue, finding that interest relates to lower fatigue. An internal meta-analysis of the four studies finds a small but robust effect of interest on both the willingness to exert greater effort and the experience of less fatigue (despite engaging in more effort).},

They then were presented a math task with the chance to earn an incentive if they met a low- or high performance standard. Analyses indicated higher reports of clarity during work among participants provided positive clarity instructions and a crossover clarity instruction x performance standard interaction for heart rate response. Responses were stronger for positive instruction participants when the standard was high, but stronger for negative instruction participants when it was low. Findings provide distinctive support for the assumption and suggest a fresh strategy for evaluating the impact of nocebo/placebo and other interventions on subjective experience.},

Twelve resistance trained men (26.6 \textpm{} 4.5 yrs; 179.0 \textpm{} 5.5 cm; 92.2 \textpm{} 24.6 kg) performed five sets of identical 10-repetition maximum (10-RM) tests for the BS, BP, LP45 exercises, each set with a different interval between tests: 1) twenty-four hours (Post-24), 2) thirty-six hours (Post-36), 3) forty-eight hours (Post-48), 4) seventy-two (Post-72), and 5) ninety-six hours (Post-96). Significant differences in 10-RM from pretest to posttest were observed for BS in Post-24 (p {$<$} 0.001; {$\Delta\%$} = -12.62), Post-36 (p {$<$} 0.001; {$\Delta\%$} = -6.57), and Post-96 (p = 0.015; {$\Delta\%$} = 6.84).

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of sex, exercise order, and rest interval on neuromuscular fatigue resistance for an alternated strength training sequence of bench press (BP) and leg press (LP) exercises. METHODS: Twelve women and 16 men, both recreationally trained, performed four sessions in a random order: 1) BP followed by LP with three-minutes rest (BP+LP with rest); 2) LP followed by BP with three-minutes rest (LP+BP with rest); 3) BP followed by LP without rest interval (BP+LP no rest), and 4) LP followed by BP without rest interval (LP+BP no rest). Participants performed four sets with 100\% of 10RM load to concentric failure with the goal of completing the maximum number of repetitions in both exercises. The FI was analyzed from the first and last sets of each exercise bout. RESULTS: A main effect for sex showed that women exhibited 25.5\% (P=0.001) and 24.5\% (P=0.001) greater BP and LP fatigue than men respectively when performing 10RM. Men exhibited greater BP (P{$<$}0.0001; 34.1\%) and LP (P{$<$}0.0001; 30.5\%) fatigue resistance when a rest period was provided. Men did not show an exercise order effect for BP fatigue and exhibited greater (P=0.0003; 14.5\%) LP fatigue resistance when BP was performed first. CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrated the greater fatigue resistance of men when performing 10RM BP and LP exercises. Since men tend to experience less fatigue with the second exercise in the exercise pairing, women's training programs should be adjusted to ensure they do not parallel men's resistance training programs.},

Posterior thigh foam rolling increases knee extension fatigue and passive shoulder range-of-motion. J Strength Cond Res 33(4): 987-994, 2019-The purpose of this study was to analyze the acute effects of different foam rolling (FR) volumes on knee extensors fatigue and shoulder passive range-of-motion (PROM). Twelve recreationally active women were recruited for participation in 2 experiments separated by 3 weeks, and the same subjects performed all procedures in each experiment. In experiment 1, subjects performed 3 sets of knee extensions using a predetermined 10 repetition maximum load to momentary concentric failure: control condition (CG) with passive rest and 2 FR conditions for the hamstrings using 2 volumes (60 and 120 seconds; FR60 and FR120, respectively). Experiment 2 consisted of 2 shoulder flexion and extension baseline PROM tests. Following baseline measures, subjects performed a single 60-second bout of FR on the hamstrings. Outcome PROM measures were measured through manual goniometry immediately (post-0), 10 minutes (post-10), 20 minutes (post-20), 30 minutes (post-30), 24 hours (post-24), and 48 hours (post-48) after the intervention to assess the effects on PROM over an extended period. Fatigue index indicated significantly greater fatigue resistance for CG when compared with FR60 (p = 0.035; [INCREMENT]\% = 6.49) and FR120 (p = 0.002; [INCREMENT]\% = 9.27), and there were no significant differences between FR60 and FR120 (p = 0.513; [INCREMENT]\% = 2.78). Shoulder flexion PROM increased in post-0 as compared to baseline 1 (p = 0.002; d = 1.58), baseline 2 (p {$<$} 0.001; d = 1.92), and baseline higher measurement (p {$<$} 0.001; d = 1.59) and remained increased for post-10 as compared to baseline 2 (p = 0.017; d = 1.55). Shoulder extension PROM increased in post-0 as compared to baseline 1 (p {$<$} 0.001; d = 2.61), baseline 2 (p {$<$} 0.001; d = 2.83), and baseline higher measurement (p {$<$} 0.001; d = 2.59) and remained increased for post-10 as compared to baseline 1 (p {$<$} 0.001; d = 1.93), baseline 2 (p {$<$} 0.001; d = 2.16), and baseline higher measurement (p {$<$} 0.001; d = 1.91) and post-20 as compared to baseline 1 (p = 0.008; d = 1.58), baseline 2 (p = 0.001; d = 1.85), and baseline higher measurement (p = 0.011; d = 1.55). Foam rolling volumes equal to or greater than 60 seconds are detrimental to the ability to continually produce force in the lower extremity and should not be applied to the hamstrings muscle group between sets of knee extensions. PROM results indicate that FR applied to the hamstrings demonstrates an increase in both shoulder flexion and extension PROM. This work may have important clinical (rehabilitation) implications, as it demonstrates global effects of FR on functional outcomes.},

  abstract = {Increases in joint range-of-motion may be beneficial for improving performance and reducing injury risk. This study investigated the effects of different self-massage volumes and modalities on passive hip range-of-motion. Twenty-five recreationally resistance-trained men performed four experimental protocols using a counterbalanced, randomized, and within-subjects design; foam rolling (FR) or roller massage (RM) for 60 or 120-s. Passive hip flexion and extension range-of-motion were measured in a counterbalanced and randomized order via manual goniometry before self-massage (baseline) and immediately, 10-, 20-, and 30-min following each self-massage intervention. Following FR or RM of quadriceps, there was an increase in hip flexion range-of-motion at Post-0 (FR: {$\Delta$}\,=\,19.28{$^\circ$}; RM: {$\Delta$}\,=\,14.96{$^\circ$}), Post-10 (FR: {$\Delta$}\,=\,13.03{$^\circ$}; RM: {$\Delta$}\,=\,10.40{$^\circ$}), and Post-20 (FR: {$\Delta$}\,=\,6.00{$^\circ$}; RM: {$\Delta$}\,=\,4.64{$^\circ$}) for all protocols, but these did not exceed the minimum detectable change at Post-10 for RM60 and RM120, and Post-20 for FR60, FR120, RM60, and RM120. Similarly, hip extension range-of-motion increased at Post-0 (FR: {$\Delta$}\,=\,8.56{$^\circ$}; RM: {$\Delta$}\,=\,6.56{$^\circ$}), Post-10 (FR: {$\Delta$}\,=\,4.64{$^\circ$}; RM: {$\Delta$}\,=\,3.92{$^\circ$}), and Post-20 (FR: {$\Delta$}\,=\,2.80{$^\circ$}; RM: {$\Delta$}\,=\,1.92{$^\circ$}), but did not exceed the minimum detectable change at Post-10 for FR60, RM60, and RM120, and Post-20 for FR60, FR120, RM60, and RM120. In conclusion, both FR and RM increased hip range-of-motion but larger volumes (120- vs. 60-second) and FR produced the greatest increases. These findings have implications for self-massage prescription and implementation, in both rehabilitation and athletic populations.},

Even "artificial" findings may be regarded as interesting because they show what can occur, even if it rarely does; or, where generalizations are made, they may have added force because of artificiality of sample or setting.

Greater Manchester Integrated Care system is the first regional system in the UK to introduce delivery of system-wide, large scale physical activity supported multi-modal prehabilitation and recovery programme, Prehab4Cancer as a standard of care for cancer patients. It builds upon the successful implementation of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery~+~programme to improve surgical care in Greater Manchester. During this review we describe the journey to develop a system wide prehabilitation model for patients with cancer. Prehab4Cancer to date has focused on robust co-design, development, and implementation of an effective service model with attention paid to stakeholder engagement. This has led to receipt of high numbers of referrals from across Greater Manchester for the all the cancer groups involved.

Meal replacements in short-term weight loss and strategies for weight maintenance have not been investigated in PCOS. OBJECTIVE: We compared in overweight women with PCOS the effects of meal replacements in short-term weight-loss and longer-term carbohydrate- or fat-restriction strategies on weight maintenance and improvements in reproductive and metabolic variables. DESIGN: Overweight women with PCOS (n = 43; x +/- SD age: 32.1 +/- 5.2 y; weight: 96.1 +/- 18.4 kg) followed an 8-wk weight-loss regimen (2 meal replacements/d, 4904.4 +/- 127 kJ; phase 1) and then a 6-mo weight-maintenance carbohydrate- ({$<$}120 g/d) or fat- ({$<$}50 g/d) restriction regimen (phase 2). RESULTS: Thirty-four women completed phase 1, and 23 women completed phase 2; the proportion of dropouts was similar in the 2 groups. During phase 1, significant (P {$<$} 0.05) reductions in weight (5.6 +/- 2.4 kg), waist circumference (6.1 +/- 2.5 cm), body fat (4.1 +/- 2.2 kg), insulin (2.8 +/- 1.1 mU/L), total testosterone (0.3 +/- 0.7 nmol/L), and free androgen index (3.1 +/- 4.6) occurred; these changes were sustained during phase 2. No significant differences between diet groups were seen for any variables. At 6 mo, both approaches resulted in a net weight loss of 4.7 +/- 4.6 kg. Improvements in menstrual cyclicity occurred for 16 (57.1\%) of 28 subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Meal replacements are an effective strategy for the short-term management of PCOS. Advice on moderate fat or carbohydrate restriction was equally effective in maintaining weight reduction and improving reproductive and metabolic variables.},

  abstract = {Movements of everyday life (e.g., climbing stairs, rising from a chair, walking) are essential for older adults to stay functional and independent. Due to the aging process, muscle mass decreases and balance abilities are reduced. One major criticism of former interventions is that implemented resistance and balance exercises were not associated with movements needed in older adults' everyday life. The Functional Movement Circle for older adults (FuMoC) includes the combination of three aspects: resistance, balance, and movements of everyday life. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of training in the FuMoC with those of other training programs. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three intervention groups (IG1: FuMoC; IG2: resistance and balance training; IG3: coordination training) with a training period of 6~months and one inactive control group (CG) was conducted.

Data of 78 (43 males, 35 females) older adults were analyzed (mean age: 68.4~years). Significant (p~{$<~$}0.05) interactions between time and group were observed in most of the primary outcomes.

Second, only in the end of the 19th century showed up the first systematic enquiry on thought experiments by Ernst Mach's work. After the Mach's work, a negative attitude towards thought experiments came in the beginning of the 20th century, which went on until the Thomas Kuhn's and Karl Popper's work on thought experiments. Only from the mid-1980s did thought experiments begin to be considered relevant to scientific enterprise. Finally, we show the existing empirical and 'functional' theories which have developed about the nature and purpose of thought experiments.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: While it is accepted that resistance training can improve functional capacity in older individuals, the neuromuscular source of this improvement has yet to be identified. AIM: This study investigated the link between improved neuromuscular performance and functional capacity after a 12-week resistance training period in untrained healthy older individuals. METHODS: Fifteen older men and women (60-71~years) adhered to a 4-week control period, followed by 12~weeks of non-linear resistance training for the lower limbs. Maximum dynamic leg press strength (1-RM), maximum isometric knee extension torque and rate of torque development (RTD) were evaluated at -~4, 0, 4, 8, and 12~weeks, and muscle activity was assessed at 0, 4, 8, and 12~weeks. Functional capacity tests (chair rise, stair ascent and descent, and timed up and go) were performed at -~4, 0, and 12~weeks. RESULTS: No changes occurred during the control period, but the group increased their 1-RM strength (from 142\,\textpm\,53 to 198\,\textpm\,43~kg, p\,=\,0.001), which was accompanied by an increase in vastus lateralis activation (p\,=\,0.008) during the intervention. Increase was observed at all RTD time intervals at week 8 (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Significant improvements in all the functional capacity tests were observed at week 12 (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). DISCUSSION: Despite the expected increase in strength, RTD, muscle activity, and functional capacity, there was no significant relationship between the changes in neuromuscular performance and functional capacity. While resistance training elicits various positive improvements in healthy older individuals, actual strength gain did not influence the gain in functional capacity. CONCLUSION: The present study highlights the exact cause that improved the functional capabilities during resistance training are currently unknown.},

The purpose of this study was to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to collect studies that examined the test-retest reliability of the Five Times Sit to Stand Test (FTSST) in adults. The search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, including all studies published up to 28 December 2020. To be included, studies had to include relative reliability scores (ICC) and maximum torque or standard error of measurements (SEM) of FTSST. A total of 693 studies were initially identified, but only 8 met the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis, covering a total of 14 groups with 400 participants. Relative inter-rater reliability results (ICC = 0.937, p {$<$} 0.001, n = 400) revealed excellent reliability of FTSST to assess sitting and standing performance, lower limbs strength and balance control. Conclusion: The Five Times Sit to Stand Test is a highly reliable tool for assessing lower limbs strength, balance control, and mobility in both healthy adults and those with pathologies.},

Yet like other phenomenologically simple cognitive processes such as walking or understanding speech, concept formation and use are maddeningly complex.Research since the 1970s and the decline of the "classical view" of concepts have greatly illuminated the psychology of concepts. But persistent theoretical disputes have sometimes obscured this progress. The Big Book of Concepts goes beyond those disputes to reveal the advances that have been made, focusing on the major empirical discoveries. By reviewing and evaluating research on diverse topics such as category learning, word meaning, conceptual development in infants and children, and the basic level of categorization, the book develops a much broader range of criteria than is usual for evaluating theories of concepts.},

It is concluded that each theory provides an inadequate account of conceptual coherence (or no account at all), because none provides enough constraints on possible concepts. The authors propose that concepts are coherent to the extent that they fit people's background knowledge or naive theories about the world. These theories help to relate the concepts in a domain and to structure the attributes that are internal to a concept.

However, estimating R2 for generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) remains challenging. We have previously introduced a version of R2 that we called  for Poisson and binomial GLMMs, but not for other distributional families. Similarly, we earlier discussed how to estimate intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) using Poisson and binomial GLMMs. In this paper, we generalize our methods to all other non-Gaussian distributions, in particular to negative binomial and gamma distributions that are commonly used for modelling biological data. While expanding our approach, we highlight two useful concepts for biologists, Jensen's inequality and the delta method, both of which help us in understanding the properties of GLMMs. Jensen's inequality has important implications for biologically meaningful interpretation of GLMMs, whereas the delta method allows a general derivation of variance associated with non-Gaussian distributions. We also discuss some special considerations for binomial GLMMs with binary or proportion data. We illustrate the implementation of our extension by worked examples from the field of ecology and evolution in the R environment. However, our method can be used across disciplines and regardless of statistical environments.},

  abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the dominant statistical approach in biology, although it has many, frequently unappreciated, problems. Most importantly, NHST does not provide us with two crucial pieces of information: (1) the magnitude of an effect of interest, and (2) the precision of the estimate of the magnitude of that effect. All biologists should be ultimately interested in biological importance, which may be assessed using the magnitude of an effect, but not its statistical significance. Therefore, we advocate presentation of measures of the magnitude of effects (i.e. effect size statistics) and their confidence intervals (CIs) in all biological journals. Combined use of an effect size and its CIs enables one to assess the relationships within data more effectively than the use of p values, regardless of statistical significance. In addition, routine presentation of effect sizes will encourage researchers to view their results in the context of previous research and facilitate the incorporation of results into future meta-analysis, which has been increasingly used as the standard method of quantitative review in biology. In this article, we extensively discuss two dimensionless (and thus standardised) classes of effect size statistics: d statistics (standardised mean difference) and r statistics (correlation coefficient), because these can be calculated from almost all study designs and also because their calculations are essential for meta-analysis. However, our focus on these standardised effect size statistics does not mean unstandardised effect size statistics (e.g. mean difference and regression coefficient) are less important. We provide potential solutions for four main technical problems researchers may encounter when calculating effect size and CIs: (1) when covariates exist, (2) when bias in estimating effect size is possible, (3) when data have non-normal error structure and/or variances, and (4) when data are non-independent. Although interpretations of effect sizes are often difficult, we provide some pointers to help researchers. This paper serves both as a beginner's instruction manual and a stimulus for changing statistical practice for the better in the biological sciences.},

  abstract = {Meta-analysis has become a standard way of summarizing empirical studies in many fields, including ecology and evolution. In ecology and evolution, meta-analyses comparing two groups (usually experimental and control groups) have almost exclusively focused on comparing the means, using standardized metrics such as Cohen's / Hedges' d or the response ratio. However, an experimental treatment may not only affect the mean but also the variance. Investigating differences in the variance between two groups may be informative, especially when a treatment influences the variance in addition to or instead of the mean. In this paper, we propose the effect size statistic lnCVR (the natural logarithm of the ratio between the coefficients of variation, CV, from two groups), which enables us to meta-analytically compare differences between the variability of two groups. We illustrate the use of lnCVR with examples from ecology and evolution. Further, as an alternative approach to the use of lnCVR, we propose the combined use of ln s (the log standard deviation) and (the log mean) in a hierarchical (linear mixed) model. The use of ln s with overcomes potential limitations of lnCVR and it provides a more flexible, albeit more complex, way to examine variation beyond two-group comparisons. Relevantly, we also refer to the potential use of ln s and lnCV (the log CV) in the context of comparative analysis. Our approaches to compare variability could be applied to already published meta-analytic data sets that compare two-group means to uncover potentially overlooked effects on the variance. Additionally, our approaches should be applied to future meta-analyses, especially when one suspects a treatment has an effect not only on the mean, but also on the variance. Notably, the application of the proposed methods extends beyond the fields of ecology and evolution.},

  abstract = {Screening and diagnostic procedures often require a physician's subjective interpretation of a patient's test result using an ordered categorical scale to define the patient's disease severity. Because of wide variability observed between physicians' ratings, many large-scale studies have been conducted to quantify agreement between multiple experts' ordinal classifications in common diagnostic procedures such as mammography. However, very few statistical approaches are available to assess agreement in these large-scale settings. Many existing summary measures of agreement rely on extensions of Cohen's kappa. These are prone to prevalence and marginal distribution issues, become increasingly complex for more than three experts, or are not easily implemented. Here we propose a model-based approach to assess agreement in large-scale studies based upon a framework of ordinal generalized linear mixed models. A summary measure of agreement is proposed for multiple experts assessing the same sample of patients' test results according to an ordered categorical scale. This measure avoids some of the key flaws associated with Cohen's kappa and its extensions. Simulation studies are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the approach with comparison with commonly used agreement measures. The proposed methods are easily implemented using the software package R and are applied to two large-scale cancer agreement studies. Copyright \copyright{} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In this paper, we critically investigate Hofstadter's analogical appeals to G\"odel's [1931] First Incompleteness Theorem, whose ``diagonal'' proof supposedly contains the key ideas required for understanding both consciousness and mental causation. We maintain that bringing sophisticated results from Mathematical Logic into play cannot furnish insights which would otherwise be unavailable. Lastly, we conclude that there are simply too many weighty details left unfilled in Hofstadter's proposal. These really need to be fleshed out before we can even hope to say that our understanding of classical mind-body problems has been advanced through metamathematical parallels with G\"odel's work.},

Summary of Background Data: Literature suggests that increased volume-loads during training may aid in improving strength, and further maximises mechanical tension and metabolic stress potentially leading to increased hypertrophy. It has been suggested that a new piece of equipment, called the Slingshot could be used in training to improve performance in the bench press by enabling individuals to increase their training volume whilst using maximal loads. Method: Nine trained male participants volunteered to participate. Each participant performed a bench press one repetition maximum (1RM) test before completing repetitions to momentary failure using the Slingshot one week later. Volume-load for each condition was calculated as repetitions (n) \texttimes{} load (kg). Results: A paired samples t-Test comparing between conditions revealed a significant difference (p {$<$} 0.001) between volume loads performed unaided (96.1 \textpm{} 14.6 kg) and with the Slingshot (350 \textpm{} 103.7 kg). Conclusion: Using the slingshot in training does allow individuals to perform greater volume-loads with a maximal load; however longitudinal research must be conducted to ascertain the magnitude of any potential benefit from using it.},

Determining changes in muscle size and architecture after exercise training: One site does not fit all. J Strength Cond Res 38(4): 787--790, 2024---Different methods can be used to assess muscle hypertrophy, but the effects of training on regional changes in muscle size can be detected only using direct muscle measurements such as muscle thickness, cross-sectional area, or volume. Importantly, muscle size increases vary across regions within and between muscles after resistance training programs (i.e., heterogeneous, or nonuniform, muscle hypertrophy). Muscle architectural changes, including fascicle length and pennation angle, after resistance and stretch training programs are also region-specific. In this paper, we show that the literature indicates that a single-site measure of muscle shape does not properly capture the effects achieved after exercise training interventions and that conclusions concerning the magnitude of muscle adaptations can vary substantially depending on the muscle site to be examined. Thus, we propose that measurements of muscle size and architecture should be completed at multiple sites across regions between the agonist muscles within a muscle group and along the length of the muscles to provide an adequate picture of training effects.},

This study was designed to compare the responses of the biceps brachii to two preacher curl exercises, one performed on a cable-pulley system (CAB; in which a greater torque was applied during the exercise when elbows were flexed and biceps shortened) and one performed with a barbell (BAR; in which greater torque was applied when the elbows were extended and biceps stretched). Thirty-five young adults (CAB: 13 men, 5 women; BAR: 12 men, 5 women; age = 24 \textpm{} 5 years) performed a resistance training program three times per week for 10 weeks, with preacher curl exercises performed in three sets of 8-12 repetitions. Outcomes measured included elbow flexion peak isokinetic torque at angles of 20{$^\circ$}, 60{$^\circ$}, and 100{$^\circ$} (considering 0{$^\circ$} as elbow extended), and biceps brachii thickness (B-mode ultrasound). Following the training period, there were significant increases for both groups in elbow flexion peak torque at the 20{$^\circ$} (CAB: 30\%; BAR = 39\%; p = 0.046), 60{$^\circ$} (CAB: 27\%; BAR = 32\%; p = 0.874), and 100{$^\circ$} (CAB: 17\%; BAR = 19\%; p = 0.728), and biceps brachii thickness (CAB: 7\%; BAR = 8\%; p = 0.346). In conclusion, gains in muscular strength were greater for BAR only at longer muscle length, whereas hypertrophy was similar regardless of whether torque emphasis was carried out in the final (CAB) or initial (BAR) degrees of the range of motion of the preacher curl in young adults.},

An understanding of the expected variation in strength and the factors that contribute to this variation is important when designing experiments, describing methodologies, interpreting results, and attempting to replicate methods of others and reproduce their findings. In this review (Cores of Reproducibility in Physiology), we report on the intra- and inter-rater reliability of tests of upper and lower limb muscle strength and voluntary activation in humans. Isometric, isokinetic, and isoinertial strength exhibit good intra-rater reliability in most samples (correlation coefficients {$\geq$}0.90). However, some tests of isoinertial strength exhibit systematic bias that is not resolved by familiarization. With the exception of grip strength, few attempts have been made to examine inter-rater reliability of tests of muscle strength. The acute factors most likely to affect muscle strength and serve as a source of its variation from trial-to-trial or day-to-day include attentional focus, breathing technique, remote muscle contractions, rest periods, temperature (core, muscle), time of day, visual feedback, body and limb posture, body stabilization, acute caffeine consumption, dehydration, pain, fatigue from preceding exercise, and static stretching {$>$}60 s. Voluntary activation, the nervous system's ability to drive a muscle to create its maximal force, exhibits good intra-rater reliability when examined with twitch interpolation (correlation coefficients {$>$}0.80). However, inter-rater reliability has not been formally examined. The methodological factors most likely to influence voluntary activation are myograph compliance and sensitivity; stimulation location, intensity, and inadvertent stimulation of antagonists; joint angle (muscle length); and the resting twitch.},

  abstract = {For decades, researchers have observed that eccentric (ECC) muscle strength is greater than concentric (CON) muscle~strength. However, knowledge of the ECC:CON strength ratio is incomplete and might inform resistance exercise prescriptions. Our purposes were to determine the magnitude of the ECC:CON ratio of human skeletal muscle in vivo and explore if sex, age, joint actions/exercises, and movement velocity impact it. A total of 340 studies were identified through searches. It was possible to analyse 1516 ECC:CON ratios, aggregated from 12,546 individuals who made up 564 groups in 335 of the identified studies. Approximately 98\% of measurements occurred on isokinetic machines. Bayesian meta-analyses were performed using log-ratios as response variables then exponentiated back to raw ratios. The overall main model estimate for the ECC:CON ratio was 1.41 (95\% credible interval [CI] 1.38-1.44). The ECC:CON ratio was slightly less in men (1.38 [CI 1.34-1.41]) than women (1.47 [CI 1.43-1.51]), and greater in older adults~(1.62 [CI 1.57-1.68]) than younger adults (1.39 [CI 1.36-1.42]). The ratio was similar between grouped upper-body (1.42 [CI 1.38-1.46]) and lower-body joint actions/exercises (1.40 [CI 1.37-1.44]). However, heterogeneity in the ratio existed across joint actions/exercises, with point estimates ranging from 1.32 to 2.61. The ECC:CON ratio was most greatly impacted by movement velocity, with a 0.20\% increase in the ratio for every 1{$^\circ$}/s increase in velocity. The results show that~ECC muscle~strength is\,\textasciitilde\,40\% greater than CON muscle~strength. However, the ECC:CON ratio is greatly affected by movement velocity and to lesser extents age and sex. Differences between joint actions/exercises likely exist, but more data are needed to provide more precise estimates.},

Therefore, we conducted a meta-regression to estimate the mean and between-individuals standard deviation of the number of repetitions that can be completed at various percentages of 1RM. We also explored if the REPS\,\textasciitilde\,\%1RM relationship is moderated by sex, age, training status, and/or exercise.

More repetitions were evident in the leg press than bench press across the loading spectrum, thus separate REPS\,\textasciitilde\,\%1RM tables were developed for these two exercises. Analysis of moderators suggested little influences of sex, age, or training status on the REPS\,\textasciitilde\,\%1RM relationship, thus the general main model REPS\,\textasciitilde\,\%1RM table can be applied to all individuals and to all exercises other than the bench press and leg press.

  abstract = {Connected adaptive resistance exercise (CARE) machines are new technology purported to adjust resistance exercise loads in response to muscle fatigue. The present study examined muscle fatigue (strength loss, fatigue perceptions) during maximal eccentric-only (ECCmax-only), concentric-only (CONmax-only), and coupled ECC-CON (ECCmax-CONmax) bicep curl exercise on a CARE machine. Eleven men and nine women completed the three protocols in separate sessions and in random order. All protocols included 4 sets of 20 maximal effort muscle contractions. Strength loss was calculated as Set 4 set end load minus Set 1 highest load. The CARE machine's algorithm adjusted resistances automatically, permitting continued maximal effort repetitions without stopping. Consequently, all protocols caused substantial fatigue. Women were most susceptible to strength loss from exercise that included maximal efforts in the ECC phase, whereas men were most susceptible to strength loss from exercise that included maximal efforts in the CON phase. With ECCmax-only exercise, ECC strength loss (mean \textpm{} SD) was similar between men (55.9 \textpm{} 14.1\%) and women (56.4 \textpm{} 10.8\%). However, with CONmax-only exercise, men and women experienced 55.6 \textpm{} 6.2\% and 35.3 \textpm{} 8.7\% CON strength loss, respectively. With ECCmax-CONmax exercise, men experienced greater ECC (62.9 \textpm{} 7.7\%) and CON (77.0 \textpm{} 5.3\%) strength loss than women (ECC: 48.5 \textpm{} 15.7\%, CON: 66.2 \textpm{} 12.1\%). Heightened perceptions of fatigue and pain of the exercised limb were reported after all protocols. Women generally reported more biceps pain than men. The results illustrate CARE technology delivers ECC-only and accentuated ECC exercise feasibly. Acute responses to repeated maximal effort bicep curl exercise with such technology might differ between men and women depending on muscle contraction type.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Older adults experience considerable muscle and bone loss that are closely interconnected. The efficacy of progressive resistance training programs to concurrently reverse/slow the age-related decline in muscle strength and bone mineral density (BMD) in older adults remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to quantify concomitant changes in lower-body muscle strength and BMD in older adults following a progressive resistance training program and to determine how these changes are influenced by mode (resistance only vs. combined resistance and weight-bearing exercises), frequency, volume, load, and program length. METHODS: MEDLINE/PubMed and Embase databases were searched for articles published in English before 1 June, 2021. Randomized controlled trials reporting changes in leg press or knee extension one repetition maximum and femur/hip or lumbar spine BMD following progressive resistance training in men and/or women\,{$\geq$}\,65~years of age were included. A random-effects meta-analysis and meta-regression determined the effects of resistance training and the individual training characteristics on the percent change (∆\%) in muscle strength (standardized mean difference) and BMD (mean difference). The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool (version 2.0) and Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria. RESULTS: Seven hundred and eighty studies were identified and 14 were included. Progressive resistance training increased muscle strength (∆ standardized mean difference\,=\,1.1\%; 95\% confidence interval 0.73, 1.47; p\,{$\leq$}\,0.001) and femur/hip BMD (∆ mean difference\,=\,2.77\%; 95\% confidence interval 0.44, 5.10; p\,=\,0.02), but not BMD of the lumbar spine (∆ mean difference\,=\,1.60\%; 95\% confidence interval\,-\,1.44, 4.63; p\,=\,0.30). The certainty for improvement was greater for muscle strength compared with BMD, evidenced by less heterogeneity (I2\,=\,78.1\% vs 98.6\%) and a higher overall quality of evidence. No training characteristic significantly affected both outcomes (p\,{$>$}\,0.05), although concomitant increases in strength and BMD were favored by higher training frequencies, increases in strength were favored by resistance only and higher volumes, and increases in BMD were favored by combined resistance plus weight-bearing exercises, lower volumes, and higher loads. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive resistance training programs concomitantly increase lower-limb muscle strength and femur/hip bone mineral density in older adults, with greater certainty for strength improvement. Thus, to maximize the efficacy of progressive resistance training programs to concurrently prevent muscle and bone loss in older adults, it is recommended to incorporate training characteristics more likely to improve BMD.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The primary aim was to describe perceived exertion responses to different intensities of eccentric exercise in women and men. METHODS: 42 adults (21 men and 21 women, 7 per condition) completed elbow extension exercises with a weight corresponding to 80\%, 100\%, or 120\% of maximal voluntary concentric strength. Total work was equated by manipulating the number of repetitions in the 80\% (N = 45), 100\% (N = 36), and 120\% (N = 30) conditions. RESULTS: A two-way ANOVA showed significant main effects for the intensity and sex factors. Perceived exertion ratings were strongly dependent on exercise intensity, and women reported lower RPEs than men. A separate three-way mixed model ANOVA that included a repetition factor showed that perceived exertion ratings increased similarly across the first 30 repetitions in all exercise conditions. Significant partial correlations were found between mean RPE during the eccentric exercise bout, and the mean intensity of delayed-onset muscle pain measured from 12- to 72-h postexercise after controlling for the relative exercise intensity (r12.3 = 0.28) or the maximum concentric strength of the elbow flexors (r12.3 = 0.33). CONCLUSIONS: 1) for both women and men, there is a positive association between the intensity of eccentric exercise performed with the elbow flexors and RPE; 2) perceived exertion ratings increase significantly then plateau when repeated eccentric muscle actions are performed at constant, submaximal absolute intensities; 3) women rate eccentric exercise performed at the same intensity (relativized to MVC-C) as being less effortful compared with men; and 4) RPE during eccentric exercise can account for a small but significant amount of variability in delayed-onset muscle pain after statistically controlling for differences in strength or relative intensity.},

  abstract = {Isometric training is used in the rehabilitation and physical preparation of athletes, special populations, and the general public. However, little consensus exists regarding training guidelines for a variety of desired outcomes. Understanding the adaptive response to specific loading parameters would be of benefit to practitioners. The objective of this systematic review, therefore, was to detail the medium- to long-term adaptations of different types of isometric training on morphological, neurological, and performance variables. Exploration of the relevant subject matter was performed through MEDLINE, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and CINAHL databases. English, full-text, peer-reviewed journal articles and unpublished doctoral dissertations investigating medium- to long-term ({$\geq$}3 weeks) adaptations to isometric training in humans were identified. These studies were evaluated further for methodological quality. Twenty-six research outputs were reviewed. Isometric training at longer muscle lengths (0.86\%-1.69\%/week, ES = 0.03-0.09/week) produced greater muscular hypertrophy when compared to equal volumes of shorter muscle length training (0.08\%-0.83\%/week, ES = -0.003 to 0.07/week). Ballistic intent resulted in greater neuromuscular activation (1.04\%-10.5\%/week, ES = 0.02-0.31/week vs 1.64\%-5.53\%/week, ES = 0.03-0.20/week) and rapid force production (1.2\%-13.4\%/week, ES = 0.05-0.61/week vs 1.01\%-8.13\%/week, ES = 0.06-0.22/week). Substantial improvements in muscular hypertrophy and maximal force production were reported regardless of training intensity. High-intensity ({$\geq$}70\%) contractions are required for improving tendon structure and function. Additionally, long muscle length training results in greater transference to dynamic performance. Despite relatively few studies meeting the inclusion criteria, this review provides practitioners with insight into which isometric training variables (eg, joint angle, intensity, intent) to manipulate to achieve desired morphological and neuromuscular adaptations.},

Overweight and obesity commonly accompany the syndrome at the clinic and are significant concerns for women with PCOS. AREAS COVERED: Herein, we provide an overview of the relevant literature on weight management strategies in women with PCOS. We performed an electronic-based search using PubMed until February 2021. We aimed to summarize available evidence of different weight-reducing interventions in PCOS and outline the gaps in our current knowledge and recommend areas for further research. EXPERT OPINION: PCOS is closely linked to obesity and increased adiposity enhances severity and expression of PCOS phenotype. Current data suggest that weight loss is associated with improved metabolic, endocrine, reproductive, cardiovascular and psychological features in overweight and obese women with PCOS. Lifestyle interventions including diet and exercise, anti-obesity medications and bariatric surgery have been used as therapeutic approaches for short-term management of obesity in PCOS with varying success rates. Large and sufficiently powered studies are required in order to determine long-term effects of weight management strategies and potential benefits beyond weight loss in the syndrome. This would allow informing the guidelines to make PCOS specific evidence-based recommendations.},

  abstract = {Muscle strength declines {$\sim$}3\% per year after the age of 70. Resistance training guidelines for older adults are often based on free-weight and machine exercises, which may be inaccessible and lack carryover to activities of daily living. We tested the hypothesis that resistance training adaptations in older adults are task-specific. Thirty adults (8 males, 22 females; mean age = 71 years) were randomly assigned to participate in 6~weeks of supervised, high-intensity resistance training (twice per week) utilizing free-weight and machine exercises (traditional) versus functional activities that were overloaded with a weighted vest (functional). Participants were thoroughly familiarized with the exercises and testing prior to beginning the study. Major outcome measures included assessments of functional performance, five-repetition maximum strength, isometric knee extensor force, and quadriceps muscle size. Physical activity and nutrition were monitored. The study results demonstrate that the magnitude of improvement within a given outcome was largely dependent on group assignment, with greater improvements in gait speed and the timed-up-and-go in the functional group, but 2-3\texttimes{} greater five repetition maximum strength improvements for the trap bar deadlift, leg press, and leg extension following traditional resistance training. Both groups showed improvements in isometric knee extensor force and muscle size, suggesting that some aspects of the observed adaptations were generic, rather than specific. Overall, these novel findings suggest that, among older adults, 1) resistance training adaptations exhibit a high degree of task specificity and 2) significant improvements in functional outcomes can be achieved with the use of a weighted vest.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nowadays, there is a lack of consensus and high controversy about the most effective range of motion (ROM) to minimize the risk of injury and maximize the resistance training adaptations. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the scientific evidence examining the effects of full and partial ROM resistance training interventions on neuromuscular, functional, and structural adaptations. METHODS: The original protocol (CRD42020160976) was prospectively registered in the PROSPERO database. Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant articles from the earliest record up to and including March 2021. The RoB 2 and GRADE tools were used to judge the level of bias and quality of evidence. Meta-analyses were performed using robust variance estimation with small-sample corrections. RESULTS: Sixteen studies were finally included in the systematic review and meta-analyses. Full ROM training produced significantly greater adaptations than partial ROM on muscle strength (ES~=~0.56, p~=~0.004) and lower-limb hypertrophy (ES~=~0.88, p~=~0.027). Furthermore, although not statistically significant, changes in functional performance were maximized by the full ROM training (ES~=~0.44, p~=~0.186). Finally, no significant superiority of either ROM was found to produce changes in muscle thickness, pennation angle, and fascicle length (ES~=~0.28, p~=~0.226). CONCLUSION: Full ROM resistance training is more effective than partial ROM to maximize muscle strength and lower-limb muscle hypertrophy. Likewise, functional performance appears to be favored by the use of full ROM exercises. On the contrary, there are no large differences between the full and partial ROM interventions to generate changes in muscle architecture.},

  abstract = {The present study aimed to compare the effects of equal-volume resistance training performed with single-joint (SJ) or multi-joint exercises (MJ) on VO2max, muscle strength and body composition in physically active males. Thirty-six participants were divided in two groups: SJ group (n = 18, 182.1 \textpm{} 5.2, 80.03 \textpm{} 2.78 kg, 23.5 \textpm{} 2.7 years) exercised with only SJ exercises (e.g., dumbbell fly, knee extension, etc.) and MJ group (n = 18, 185.3 \textpm{} 3.6 cm, 80.69 \textpm{} 2.98 kg, 25.5 \textpm{} 3.8 years) with only MJ exercises (e.g., bench press, squat, etc.). The total work volume (repetitions \texttimes{} sets \texttimes{} load) was equated between groups. Training was performed three times a week for 8 weeks. Before and after the training period, participants were tested for VO2max, body composition, 1 RM on the bench press, knee extension and squat. Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to compare post training values between groups, using baseline values as covariates. According to the results, both groups decreased body fat and increased fat free mass with no difference between them. Whilst both groups significantly increased cardiorespiratory fitness and maximal strength, the improvements in MJ group were higher than for SJ in VO2max (5.1 and 12.5\% for SJ and MJ), bench press 1 RM (8.1 and 10.9\% for SJ and MJ), knee extension 1 RM (12.4 and 18.9\% for SJ and MJ) and squat 1 RM (8.3 and 13.8\% for SJ and MJ). In conclusion, when total work volume was equated, RT programs involving MJ exercises appear to be more efficient for improving muscle strength and maximal oxygen consumption than programs involving SJ exercises, but no differences were found for body composition.},

Male (n = 6) and female (n = 6) subjects attended a single testing session. Subjects completed an individualized graded exercise test (GXT) on a treadmill as determined by the WLTS. Heart rate (bpm), rate of perceived exertion, and blood lactate (mmol{$\cdot$}L-1) were taken at rest, at the end of each stage of exercise, and immediately post-exercise. Results for LT determined by the WLTS were compared to two traditional methods of LT determination, onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA; Blood lactate {$>$}4 mmol{$\cdot$}L-1) and an increase in blood lactate of 1 mmol/L ({$>$}1 mmol{$\cdot$}L-1) between two consecutive exercise stages. A RM ANOVA revealed a significant difference between the three methods of LT determination (F (1.501, 13.511) = 9.160, P{$<$}0.002). Post hoc tests indicated that there was a significant difference (P = 0.001) between the treadmill speed (TS) where LT occurred using the WLTS (6.084 mph) and the criteria of {$>$}1 mmol{$\cdot$}L-1 (5.554 mph), and a significant difference (P = 0.027) between the TS where LT occurred using the WLTS (6.084 mph) and OBLA (5.672 mph). There was no significant difference (P{$>$}0.05) between the TS where LT occurred between {$>$}1 mmol{$\cdot$}L-1 (5.554 mph) and OBLA (5.672 mph). In conclusion, the WLTS is not a valid way to determine LT when compared to the accepted methods of LT determination. ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR},

As there is a loss of strength in elderly, many treatments are based on delaying the loss of strength or maintaining it. Isokinetic dynamometry is the gold standard for assessing strength. It is essential that studies are conducted to allow us to identify the reliability of isokinetic strength assessments in older people. This study aimed to test the absolute and relative intra-session reliability of peak torque and work of a concentric knee extension-flexion performed at 60{$^\circ$}/s in elderly. Fifty-two elderly subjects performed three repetitions of bilateral concentric knee extension-flexion at 60{$^\circ$}/s using an isokinetic dynamometer. The relative and absolute reliability were calculated between the second and third repetition. The intra-class correlation coefficient values were between 0.94 and 0.98 for peak torque and work in all measures, which is considered ``excellent'', except for left leg flexors in women, with values between 0.85 and 0.88, which is considered ``good''. The standard error of measurement (SEM) percentage oscillated from 3.9\% to 10.5\%, with a smallest real difference (SRD) percentage of 10.9\% to 29.2\% for peak torque. The relative reliability of peak torque and work were excellent for all measures except flexors in women, evidencing the utility of isokinetic dynamometry for monitoring lower limb maximal muscle strength and work of concentric knee extension-flexion at 60{$^\circ$}/s/s in the elderly. In addition, an SRD {$>$} 19.9\% in peak torque and an SRD {$>$} 23.1\% in work is considered a true change.},

In contrast, the students' self-efficacy for mechanical tasks did relatively poorly in predicting mechanical test performance (r=.10). Most interesting were two other findings: (a) The best predictor of domain performance was level of cross-domain performance by far, even for mechanical tasks, and (b) self-enhancement tendencies added to cross-domain abilities and self-efficacy beliefs in the prediction of performance.

A total of 722 adult Caucasian subjects were enrolled in this analysis. After taking a detailed medical history, the study enrolled non-hospitalized subjects with medically and nutritionally controlled diseases such as diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and thyroid disease, excluding subjects with active infections and pregnant or lactating women. Measurement of somatometric characteristics and indirect calorimetry were performed. The values obtained from RMR measurement were compared with the values of the new equations and the Harris--Benedict, Mifflin--St Jeor, FAO/WHO/UNU, and Owen equations. New predictive RMR equations were developed using age, body weight, height, and sex parameters. RMR males: (9.65 \texttimes{} weight in kg) + (573 \texttimes{} height in m) - (5.08 \texttimes{} age in years) + 260; RMR females: (7.38 \texttimes{} weight in kg) + (607 \texttimes{} height in m) - (2.31 \texttimes{} age in years) + 43; RMR males: (4.38 \texttimes{} weight in pounds) + (14.55 \texttimes{} height in inches) - (5.08 \texttimes{} age in years) + 260; RMR females: (3.35 \texttimes{} weight in pounds) + (15.42 \texttimes{} height in inches) - (2.31 \texttimes{} age in years) + 43. The accuracy of the new equations was tested in the test group in both groups, in accordance with the resting metabolic rate measurements. The new equations showed more accurate results than the other equations, with the equation for men (R-squared: 0.95) showing better prediction than the equation for women (R-squared: 0.86). The new equations showed good accuracy at both group and individual levels, and better reliability compared to other equations using the same anthropometric variables as predictors of RMR. The new equations were created under modern obesogenic conditions, and do not exclude individuals with regulated (dietary or pharmacological) Westernized diseases (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and thyroid disease).},

  abstract = {It is tempting to treat frequency trends from the Google Books data sets as indicators of the ``true'' popularity of various words and phrases. Doing so allows us to draw quantitatively strong conclusions about the evolution of cultural perception of a given topic, such as time or gender. However, the Google Books corpus suffers from a number of limitations which make it an obscure mask of cultural popularity. A primary issue is that the corpus is in effect a library, containing one of each book. A single, prolific author is thereby able to noticeably insert new phrases into the Google Books lexicon, whether the author is widely read or not. With this understood, the Google Books corpus remains an important data set to be considered more lexicon-like than text-like. Here, we show that a distinct problematic feature arises from the inclusion of scientific texts, which have become an increasingly substantive portion of the corpus throughout the 1900s. The result is a surge of phrases typical to academic articles but less common in general, such as references to time in the form of citations. We use information theoretic methods to highlight these dynamics by examining and comparing major contributions via a divergence measure of English data sets between decades in the period 1800--2000. We find that only the English Fiction data set from the second version of the corpus is not heavily affected by professional texts. Overall, our findings call into question the vast majority of existing claims drawn from the Google Books corpus, and point to the need to fully characterize the dynamics of the corpus before using these data sets to draw broad conclusions about cultural and linguistic evolution.},

The hierarchical GAM (HGAM), allows modeling of nonlinear functional relationships between covariates and outcomes where the shape of the function itself varies between different grouping levels. We describe the theoretical connection between HGAMs, HGLMs, and GAMs, explain how to model different assumptions about the degree of intergroup variability in functional response, and show how HGAMs can be readily fitted using existing GAM software, the mgcv package in R. We also discuss computational and statistical issues with fitting these models, and demonstrate how to fit HGAMs on example data.

Forty-five untrained women were randomized to either a control group or to perform the exercise in one of the following 4 groups (0{$^\circ$}=extended knee): Full ROM (FULLROM: 100{$^\circ-$}30{$^\circ$} of knee flexion); Initial Partial ROM (INITIALROM: 100{$^\circ-$}65{$^\circ$}); Final Partial ROM (FINALROM: 65{$^\circ-$}30{$^\circ$}); Varied ROM (VARROM: daily alternation between the ROM of INITIALROM and FINALROM). Pre- and post-training assessments included one repetition maximum (1RM) testing in the ROM corresponding to the initial, final and full ROM, and measurement of cross-sectional areas of the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis muscles at 40\%, 50\%, 60\% and 70\% of femur length in regard to regional muscle hypertrophy. Results showed that the INITIALROM group presented a greater relative increase than all groups at 70\%, and at 50\% and 60\% the increases were greater than FINALROM, FULLROM, and non-training control (CON) groups. Moreover, FINALROM group presented similar changes compared to the CON group at 60\% and 70\%. In regard to 1RM, FINALROM and INITIALROM groups presented greater relative increases at the ROM trained, and no group showed greater increases than VARROM or INITIALROM, regardless the ROM tested. In conclusion, partial ROM training in the initial phase of the knee extension exercise promoted greater relative hypertrophy in certain muscle regions than training in other ROM configurations, and no group promoted a greater 1RM increase than VARROM group, which showed similar 1RM increases in the different ROMs tested.},

  abstract = {Objective: The effects of ROM manipulation on muscle strength and hypertrophy response remain understudied in long-term interventions. Thus, we compared the changes in strength and regional muscle hypertrophy after training in protocols with different ranges of motion (ROM) in the seated dumbbell preacher curl exercise using a within-participant experimental design. Design and methods: Nineteen young women had one arm randomly assigned to train in the initial ROM (INITIALROM: 0\textopenbullet --68\textopenbullet; 0\textopenbullet{} = extended elbow) while the contralateral arm trained in the final ROM (FINALROM: 68\textopenbullet --135\textopenbullet ), three times per week over an eight-week study period. Pre- and posttraining assessments included one repetition maximum (1RM) testing in the full ROM (0\textopenbullet --135\textopenbullet ), and measurement of biceps brachii cross-sectional area (CSA) at 50\% and 70\% of humerus length. Paired t-tests were used to compare regional CSA changes between groups, the sum of CSA changes at 50\% and 70\% (CSAsummed), and the strength response between the training protocols. Results: The INITIALROM protocol displayed a greater CSA increase than FINALROM protocol at 70\% of biceps length (p = 0.001). Alternatively, we observed similar increases between the protocols for CSA at 50\% (p = 0.311) and for CSAsummed (p = 0.111). Moreover, the INITIALROM protocol displayed a greater 1RM increase than FINALROM (p {$<$} 0.001). Conclusions: We conclude that training in the initial angles of elbow flexion exercise promotes greater distal hypertrophy of the biceps brachii muscle in untrained young women. Moreover, the INITIALROM condition promotes a greater dynamic strength increase when tested at a full ROM compared to the FINALROM.},

  abstract = {Despite the terms' often being used interchangeably, it has been suggested that perceptions of effort and perceptions of exertion may differ. Eccentric (ECC) cycling may provide a model of exercise by which differences between these perceptions can be examined. PURPOSE: To examine and compare perceptions of effort and exertion during ECC and concentric (CONC) cycling at 4 intensities. METHODS: Ten healthy male participants (mean [SD]: age = 29.8 [2.3] y) performed an incremental cycling test for the determination of maximal aerobic power output, followed in a randomized and crossover design, by four 5-min bouts (30\%, 60\%, 80\%, and maximal) of either ECC or CONC cycling. Through each bout, participants were asked to report their perceived effort, exertion, and muscle pain. Heart rate and oxygen consumption were continuously recorded throughout each bout. RESULTS: Perceived exertion was greater for CONC at 30\% (8.5 [1.5] vs 7.1 [1.8]; P\,=\,.01), 60\% (12.4 [1.4] vs 10.3 [2.0]; P\,=\,.01), 80\% (15.8 [1.7] vs 12.4 [2.5]; P\,{$<$}\,.01), and maximal (17.2\,[1.3] vs 15.6 [1.8]; P\,=\,.03) in comparison with ECC. Perceptions of effort and pain were similar between CONC and ECC. Heart rate and oxygen consumption were greater during CONC than ECC. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived exertion was greater during CONC compared with ECC cycling, yet effort was similar between conditions despite different physiological stress. Such findings have implications for understanding the development of such perceptions during exercise.},

The subtle difference has important implications, as many studies use strain as an indicator for injury risk. In addition, we show that the data better supports a theory of stress as the principal cause of injury, rather than force alone, and aligns with both the myofibril and observational data.

DESIGN: Population-based cohort study. SETTING: Data from six Swedish national registers, with participants being followed for a maximum of 19 years. PATIENT(S): All women with an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, version 10, diagnosis of PCOS, androgen excess, or anovulatory infertility born between 1950 and 1999 (n = 52,535) were identified in the Patient Register. The HA PCOS phenotype was defined by two filled prescriptions for anti-androgenic drugs. For each woman with PCOS, five control women (n = 254,624) were randomly chosen from the Total Population Register, matched for age and geographic area. INTERVENTION(S): No interventions were performed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, version 10, diagnosis of T2D or prescription of antidiabetic treatment other than metformin. RESULT(S): The cumulative incidence rates of T2D were 1.3\%, 4.4\%, and 14.2\% in controls (non-PCOS women) and women with normoandrogenic (NA) and HA PCOS, respectively. After adjustment for BMI, women with PCOS had a twofold higher rate of T2D than non-PCOS women (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.52 [95\% confidence interval, 2.15-2.96]). Women with HA PCOS had a higher rate of T2D than those with NA PCOS (adjusted hazard ratio, 3.86 [95\% confidence interval, 3.16-4.72]). CONCLUSION(S): Polycystic ovary syndrome is an independent risk factor for T2D, even after adjustment for BMI. Women with the HA PCOS phenotype face an even higher risk of T2D than those with the NA PCOS phenotype.},

METHODS: A population-based birth cohort study included women with (n~=~278) and without PCOS (control individuals, n~=~1560) who were examined at ages 31 and 46\,years with questionnaires and clinical examinations. RESULTS: Women with PCOS had more weight-loss attempts compared with control individuals at age 31 (47\% vs. 34\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and 46\,years (63\% vs. 47\%, p\,{$<$}\,0.001). At age 46\,years, PCOS was associated with multiple weight-loss attempts in the adjusted model (odds ratio: 1.43 [95\% CI: 1.00-2.03], p~=~0.05). The perception of having overweight was more prevalent in those with PCOS, even among participants with normal weight, at age 31 (PCOS 47\% vs. control 34\%, p~=~0.014) and 46\,years (PCOS 60\% vs. control 39\%, p~=~0.001).

  abstract = {It is well established that exercise is an important component in the maintenance of good health, and yet recent studies have demonstrated that a sub-section of individuals experience no significant improvements following an exercise training intervention. Such individuals are commonly termed "non-responders". However, recently a number of researchers have taken a skeptical view as to whether exercise non-response either exists, or is clinically relevant. Here, we explore the research underpinning exercise response, to determine whether non-response to exercise actually exists. We discuss the impact of measurement error and assessment type on the identification of "non-responders", and whether such non-response is global- or modality-specific. Additionally, we discuss whether, if non-response to an exercise intervention is meaningful and relevant, certain additional interventions-in the form of increasing exercise intensity, volume, or duration-could be made in order to enhance training adaptations. Consequently, based on our interpretations of the available evidence, we suggest that it is unlikely that global non-responders to exercise exist. Furthermore, we suggest this realization effectively counters the perception that some individuals will not positively respond to exercise, and that in turn, this insight serves to encourage health professionals to create more nuanced, efficacious, and individually-focused exercise prescriptions designed to circumvent and overcome apparent non-responsiveness. Adopting a more individually-adaptive approach to exercise prescription could, subsequently, prove a powerful tool in promoting population health.},

Volunteers were randomly assigned to 3 groups: (a) full range of motion (FULL; n = 15), (b) partial range of motion (PART; n = 15), or (c) control (CON; n = 10). The subjects trained 2 d {$\cdot$} wk(-1) for 10 weeks in a periodized program. Primary outcome measures included elbow flexion maximal strength measured by 1 repetition maximum (1RM) and elbow flexors MT measured by ultrasound. The results indicated that elbow flexion 1RM significantly increased (p {$<$} 0.05) for the FULL (25.7 \textpm{} 9.6\%) and PART groups (16.0 \textpm{} 6.7\%) but not for the CON group (1.7 \textpm{} 5.5\%). Also, FULL 1RM strength was significantly greater than the PART 1RM after the training period. Average elbow flexor MT significantly increased for both training groups (9.65 \textpm{} 4.4\% for FULL and 7.83 \textpm{} 4.9 for PART). These data suggest that muscle strength and MT can be improved with both FULL and PART resistance training, but FULL may lead to greater strength gains.},

The EG performed two to three sets of 12-15 repeats of leg press, knee extension, and knee flexion exercises, 2 days/week for 6 weeks. Before and after training, lower body one repetition maximum (1RM), functional performance tests, quadriceps femoris muscle thickness (MT), and muscle quality (MQ) (1RM and quadriceps MT quotient) were assessed. After training, only the EG showed significant improvements in 1RM (p {$<$} 0.05), 30-s sit-to-stand (p {$<$} 0.001), and 8 foot up-and-go (p {$<$} 0.001). In addition, only in the EG, significant increases in all quadriceps femoris MT measurements (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and rectus femoris) (p {$\leq$} 0.05), and MQ (p {$<$} 0.001) were demonstrated. No changes were observed in the CG. Furthermore, there were significant associations between individual changes in MQ and corresponding changes in 30-s sit-to-stand (r = 0.62, p {$<$} 0.001), and 8 foot up-and-go (r = -0.71, p {$<$} 0.001). In conclusion, a ST program of only 6 weeks was sufficient to enhance MQ of the knee extensors in elderly women, which resulted in beneficial changes in functional capacity.},

Aim This study aims at exploring differential effects of enjoyment and competence beliefs on two external validity criteria in the field of mathematics. Sample Data analysed in this study were part of a large-scale longitudinal research project. Following a five-wave design, math enjoyment, math competence beliefs, math achievement, and perceived math effort expenditure measures were repeatedly collected from a cohort of 4,724 pupils in Grades 3--7. Method Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to test the internal factor structure of the math self-concept. Additionally, a series of nested models was tested using structural equation modelling to examine longitudinal reciprocal interrelations between math competence beliefs and math enjoyment on the one hand and math achievement and perceived math effort expenditure on the other. Results Our results showed that CFA models with separate factors for math enjoyment and math competence beliefs fit the data substantially better than models without it. Furthermore, differential relationships between both constructs and the two educational outcomes were observed. Math competence beliefs had positive effects on math achievement and negative effects on perceived math effort expenditure. Math enjoyment had (mild) positive effects on subsequent perceived effort expenditure and math competence beliefs. Conclusion This study provides further support for the affect-competence separation. Theoretical issues regarding adequate conceptualization and practical consequences for practitioners are discussed.},

Data from 899 women with (n = 501) and without (n = 398) PCOS were analysed as possibly indicative of disordered eating or eating disorders using the Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDE-Q) and The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria.

The aim of this article is to give some basic thoughts about the nature of sport and to present, confront and evaluate different concepts of science with their different rival approaches and understanding of sport. In general three major groups of sciences can be differentiated: natural sciences and social sciences which share common quantitative (empirical and mathematical based) methodology of research, and human sciences or humanities with their method of reflection (the analysis of concepts and rational argumentation) which go beyond empirically measurable things. Because of different scientific approaches, different understanding and concepts of sport arise which try to prevail over in society. Our comprehension of sport is therefore greatly influenced by pre-accepted methodological position. If sport is equated with physical human body movement, then natural science with its empirical methodology seems to be adequate way for cognition of sport. For social scientists sport has important role in society, therefore it cannot be reduced to mere ``body movement''. But humanists would say that sport is more than ``body in movement'' with influence in society: sport is a powerful idea or concept},

  abstract = {Although in some contexts the notions of an ordinary argument's presumption, assumption, and presupposition appear to merge into the one concept of an implicit premise, there are important differences between these three notions. It is argued that assumption and presupposition, but not presumption, are basic logical notions. A presupposition of an argument is best understood as pertaining to a propositional element (a premise or the conclusion) e of the argument, such that the presupposition is a necessary condition for the truth of e or for a term in e to have a referent. In contrast, an assumption of an argument pertains to the argument as a whole in that it is integral to the reasoning or inferential structure of the argument. A logical assumption of an argument is essentially a proposition that must be true in order for the argument aside from that proposition to be fully cogent. Nothing that is both comparable and distinguishing can be said about presumptions of arguments. Rather, presumptions of arguments are distinctively conventional; they are introduced through conventional rules (e.g., those that concern how to treat promises). So not all assumptions and not all presuppositions of arguments are presumptions of those arguments, although all presumptions of arguments are either assumptions or presuppositions of those arguments. This account avoids making the (monological) notion of presumption vacuous and dissolving the distinction between assumption and presumption, which is a vulnerability of alternative views such as Hansen's and Bermejo-Luque's, as is shown.},

PCOS is associated with hyperinsulinemia, which is known to impair fat oxidation. Research shows that carbohydrates from dairy and starch-based foods cause greater postprandial insulin secretion than carbohydrates from nonstarchy vegetables and fruits. The purpose of this study was to determine whether an ad libitum 8-week low-starch/low-dairy diet would improve fasting and postprandial fat oxidation after a high saturated fat liquid meal (HSFLM) in overweight and obese women with PCOS. Prospective 8-week dietary intervention using a low-starch/low-dairy diet in 10 women (body mass index {$\geq$}25 kg/m(2) and {$\leq$}45 kg/m(2)) with PCOS. Indirect calorimetry was used at fasting and for 5 h following consumption of the HSFLM to determine respiratory exchange ratio (RER), macronutrient oxidation, and energy expenditure (EE) at week 0 and week 8. Participants had a reduction in body weight (-8.1 \textpm{} 1.8 kg, p {$<$} 0.05) and fasting insulin (-19.5 \textpm{} 8.9 {$\mu$}g/mL, p {$<$} 0.05) after dietary intervention; however, these were not significantly correlated with improved fat oxidation. There was a reduction in fasting RER, and fasting and postprandial carbohydrate oxidation, and an increase in fasting and postprandial fat oxidation after adjusting for body weight. There was also significant difference in incremental area under the curve from pre- to post-diet for fat (0.06 \textpm{} 0.00 g/kg per 5 h; p {$<$} 0.001) and carbohydrate oxidation (-0.29 \textpm{} 0.06 g/kg per 5 h; p {$<$} 0.001), but not for RER or EE. In conclusion, an 8-week low-starch/low-dairy diet increased fat oxidation in overweight and obese women with PCOS.},

  abstract = {: The hyperbolic form of the power-duration relationship is rigorous and highly conserved across species, forms of exercise, and individual muscles/muscle groups. For modalities such as cycling, the relationship resolves to two parameters, the asymptote for power (critical power [CP]) and the so-called W' (work doable above CP), which together predict the tolerable duration of exercise above CP. Crucially, the CP concept integrates sentinel physiological profiles-respiratory, metabolic, and contractile-within a coherent framework that has great scientific and practical utility. Rather than calibrating equivalent exercise intensities relative to metabolically distant parameters such as the lactate threshold or V˙O2max, setting the exercise intensity relative to CP unifies the profile of systemic and intramuscular responses and, if greater than CP, predicts the tolerable duration of exercise until W' is expended, V˙O2max is attained, and intolerance is manifested. CP may be regarded as a "fatigue threshold" in the sense that it separates exercise intensity domains within which the physiological responses to exercise can ({$<$}CP) or cannot ({$>$}CP) be stabilized. The CP concept therefore enables important insights into 1) the principal loci of fatigue development (central vs. peripheral) at different intensities of exercise and 2) mechanisms of cardiovascular and metabolic control and their modulation by factors such as O2 delivery. Practically, the CP concept has great potential application in optimizing athletic training programs and performance as well as improving the life quality for individuals enduring chronic disease.},

It provides one of the clearest and most accessible statements of the fundamental idea that guided his work: not only our knowledge, but our aims and our standards, grow through an unending process of trial and error. Popper brilliantly demonstrates how knowledge grows by guesses or conjectures and tentative solutions, which must then be subjected to critical tests. Although they may survive any number of tests, our conjectures remain conjectures, they can never be established as true. What makes Conjectures and Refutations such an enduring book is that Popper goes on to apply this bold theory of the growth of knowledge to a fascinating range of important problems, including the role of tradition, the origin of the scientific method, the demarcation between science and metaphysics, the body-mind problem, the way we use language, how we understand history, and the dangers of public opinion. Throughout the book, Popper stresses the importance of our ability to learn from our mistakes. Conjectures and Refutations is essential reading, and a book to be returned to again and again.},

Unfortunately, empirical support for this premise has heretofore been lacking. We provide evidence that philosophical study has such effects. Using a large dataset (including records from over half a million undergraduates at hundreds of institutions across the United States), we investigate philosophy students' performance on verbal and logical reasoning tests, as well as measures of valuable intellectual dispositions. Results indicate that students with stronger verbal abilities, and who are more curious, open-minded, and intellectually rigorous, are more likely to study philosophy. Nonetheless, after accounting for such baseline differences, philosophy majors outperform all other majors on tests of verbal and logical reasoning and on a measure of valuable habits of mind. This offers the strongest evidence to date that studying philosophy does indeed make people better thinkers.},

Capillary blood samples were drawn from elite athletes in both laboratory and field settings and analysed in parallel. Accuracy was determined in relation to three other lactate analysers: (1) the ABL 700 Series Acid-Base analyser (n = 172 cases), (2) the Accusport Lactate Meter (n = 118 cases), and (3) the YSI 2300 Stat lactate analyser (n = 22 cases). The level of agreement was determined over the range of 1-18 mM. The repeatability of results between two different Lactate Pro analysers was also determined over the same range. Versatility was assessed in the field, where the Lactate Pro was used with elite athletes under a range of outdoor and indoor testing conditions. The correlations between the Lactate Pro and the ABL 700 Series Acid-Base analyser, YSI 2300 and Accusport were r = 0.98, r = 0.99, r = 0.97. The correlation between the two Lactate Pro analysers on the same sample (n = 96 cases) was r = 0.99. The level of agreement between the Lactate Pro and other analysers was generally less than +/- 2.0 mM over the physiological range of 1.0-18.0 mM (range of mean difference: -0.06 mM to 0.52 mM). The Lactate Pro was easy to operate and successfully completed the sample analysis in 100\% of the tests performed. In summary, the Lactate Pro is accurate, reliable and exhibits a high degree of agreement with other lactate analysers.},

  abstract = {Current debate exists around whether a presumed eccentric exercise, the Nordic hamstring exercise (NHE), actually causes active hamstring muscle lengthening. This is because of the decoupling that can occur between the muscle fascicle and muscle-tendon unit (MTU) length changes in relatively compliant human lower-limb MTUs, which results in MTU lengthening not necessarily causing muscle fascicle lengthening. This missing knowledge complicates the interpretation of why the NHE is effective at reducing running-related hamstring muscle injury risk in athletes previously unfamiliar with performing this exercise. The purpose of the study was therefore to investigate if the most-commonly injured hamstring muscle, the biceps femoris long head (BF), exhibits active muscle lengthening (i.e. an eccentric muscle action) during the NHE up until peak force in Nordic novices. External reaction force at the ankle, knee flexion angle, and BF and semitendinosus muscle activities were recorded from the left leg of 14 participants during the NHE. Simultaneously, BF muscle architecture was imaged using B-mode ultrasound imaging, and muscle architecture changes were tracked using two different tracking algorithms. From \textasciitilde 85 to 100\% of peak NHE force, both tracking algorithms detected that BF muscle fascicles ( n = 10) significantly lengthened ( p \&lt; 0.01) and had a mean positive lengthening velocity ( p {$\leq$} 0.02), while knee extension velocity remained positive (17{$^\circ\cdot$}s -1 ) over knee flexion angles from 53 to 37{$^\circ$} and a duration of 1.6 s. Despite some individual cases of brief isometric fascicle behavior and brief fascicle shortening during BF MTU lengthening, the predominant muscle action was eccentric under a relatively high muscle activity level (59\% of maximum). Eccentric hamstring muscle action therefore does occur during the NHE in relatively strong (429 N) Nordic novices, which might contribute to the increase in resting BF muscle fascicle length and reduction in running-related injury risk, which have previously been reported following NHE training. Whether an eccentric BF muscle action occurs in individuals accustomed to the NHE remains to be tested.}

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: We compared the effects of eccentrically biased (EB) and conventional (CONV) resistance training on muscle architecture, one-repetition maximum (1RM), isometric strength, isokinetic force-velocity characteristics, functional capacity, and pulse wave velocity in older men and women. METHODS: Twenty-eight older adults participated in the study (mean \textpm{} SD: age = 68 \textpm{} 5 yr). Of these, 13 were allocated to a waitlist control, 10 of whom progressed to training (CONV, n = 12; EB, n = 13). Training was twice a week for 16 wk. EB involved three sets of 10 concentric lifts at 50\% of 1RM with the eccentric portion of repetitions performed unilaterally, alternating between limbs with each repetition. CONV involved two sets of 10 repetitions at 75\% of 1RM. EB and CONV were matched for total work. Isokinetic knee extensor strength was assessed across a range of velocities (0-360{$^\circ\cdot$}s(-1)). Functional capacity was assessed via a 6-m fast walk test, a timed up and go test, stair climb and descent power test, and vertical jump test. Vastus lateralis and gastrocnemius medialis architecture were assessed using ultrasonography. RESULTS: Both EB and CONV improved 1RM ({$\Delta$} 23\%-35\%, P {$<$} 0.01). Compared to the control group, both training regimens improved 6-m fast walk ({$\Delta$} 5\%-7\%, P {$<$} 0.01) and concentric torque at 60 and 120{$^\circ\cdot$}s(-1) ({$\Delta$} 6\%-8\%, P {$<$} 0.05). Significant improvements were evident in EB for isometric and concentric torque at 240 and 360{$^\circ\cdot$}s(-1) ({$\Delta$} 6\%-11\%, P {$<$} 0.05), vastus lateralis thickness ({$\Delta$} 5\%, P {$<$} 0.05), and stair climb ({$\Delta$} 5\%, P {$<$} 0.01). Timed up and go ({$\Delta$} 5\%, P {$<$} 0.01), stair descent ({$\Delta$} 4\%, P {$<$} 0.05), and vertical jump ({$\Delta$} 7\%, P {$<$} 0.01) improved in CONV. Pulse wave velocity, pennation angle, and fascicle length remained unchanged in both training groups. CONCLUSIONS: EB seems superior to CONV at increasing torque at high contraction velocities, whereas CONV seems more effective at improving some functional performance measures and vertical jump. This has important implications for preserving functional capacity.},

Monte carlo study results, comparing these indexes with Lord's {$\chi$}2 test, the signed area measure, and the unsigned area measure, demonstrate that the DFIT framework is accu rate in assessing DTF, COIF, and NCDIF.},

  abstract = {The transfer of training effects of multiple-joint isokinetic resistance training to dynamic exercise performance remain poorly understood. Thus, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the magnitude of isokinetic and dynamic one repetition-maximum (1RM) strength and local muscular endurance increases after 6 weeks of multiple-joint isokinetic resistance training. Seventeen women were randomly assigned to either an isokinetic resistance training group (IRT) or a non-exercising control group (CTL). The IRT group underwent 6 weeks of training (2 days per week) consisting of 5 sets of 6-10 repetitions at 75-85\% of subjects' peak strength for the isokinetic chest press and seated row exercises at an average linear velocity of 0.15 m s(-1) [3-sec concentric (CON) and 3-sec eccentric (ECC) phases]. Peak CON and ECC force during the chest press and row, 1RM bench press and bent-over row, and maximum number of modified push-ups were assessed pre and post training. A 2 x 2 analysis of variance with repeated measures and Tukey's post hoc tests were used for data analysis. The results showed that 1RM bench press (from 38.6 \textpm{} 6.7 to 43.0 \textpm{} 5.9 kg), 1RM bent-over row (from 40.4 \textpm{} 7.7 to 45.5 \textpm{} 7.5 kg), and the maximal number of modified push-ups (from 39.5 \textpm{} 13.6 to 55.3 \textpm{} 13.1 repetitions) increased significantly only in the IRT group. Peak isokinetic CON and ECC force in the chest press and row significantly increased in the IRT group. No differences were shown in the CTL group for any measure. These data indicate 6 weeks of multiple-joint isokinetic resistance training increases dynamic muscle strength and local muscular endurance performance in addition to specific isokinetic strength gains in women. Key pointsMultiple-joint isokinetic resistance training increases dynamic maximal muscular strength, local muscular endurance, and maximal isokinetic strength in women.Multiple-joint isokinetic resistance training increased 1RM strength in the bench press (by 10.2\%), bent-over barbell row (by 11.2\%), and maximal modified push-up performance (by 28.6\%) indicating a carryover of training effects to dynamic exercise performance.The carryover effects may be attractive to strength training and conditioning professionals seeking to include alternative modalities such as multiple-joint isokinetic dynamometers to resistance training programs.},

Resistance-trained males (n = 12) and females (n = 6) completed an 8-week intervention involving two RT sessions per week. The lower limbs of each participant were randomised to perform the leg press and leg extension exercises either to (i) momentary muscular failure (FAIL) or (ii) a perceived 2-RIR and 1-RIR, respectively, for the entire intervention. In weeks one, four, and eight, post-set ratings of perceived discomfort (RPD), and post-session ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) and general feelings via feeling scale (FS) were measured. Data were analysed with Bayesian mixed-effect models. When averaged over all time points measured, results showed slightly greater RPD for FAIL [5.1 (HDI: 4.2--6.0); pd = 100\%] versus RIR [4.1 (HDI: 3.2--5.1); pd = 100\%], greater RPE for FAIL [5.4 (HDI: 4.6--6.3); pd = 100\%] versus RIR [4.3 (HDI: 3.5--5.1); pd = 100\%], and more positive general feelings for RIR [1.2 (HDI: 0.7--1.8); pd = 100\%] versus FAIL [0.3 (HDI: -0.3 to 0.8); pd = 86\%].

  abstract = {While proximity-to-failure is considered an important resistance training (RT) prescription variable, its influence on physiological adaptations and short-term responses to RT is uncertain. Given the ambiguity in the literature, a scoping review was undertaken to summarise evidence for the influence of proximity-to-failure on muscle hypertrophy, neuromuscular fatigue, muscle damage and perceived discomfort. Literature searching was performed according to PRISMA-ScR guidelines and identified three themes of studies comparing either: i) RT performed to momentary muscular failure versus non-failure, ii) RT performed to set failure (defined as anything other than momentary muscular failure) versus non-failure, and iii) RT performed to different velocity loss thresholds. The findings highlight that no consensus definition for "failure" exists in the literature, and the proximity-to-failure achieved in "non-failure" conditions is often ambiguous and variable across studies. This poses challenges when deriving practical recommendations for manipulating proximity-to-failure in RT to achieve desired outcomes. Based on the limited available evidence, RT to set failure is likely not superior to non-failure RT for inducing muscle hypertrophy, but may exacerbate neuromuscular fatigue, muscle damage, and post-set perceived discomfort versus non-failure RT. Together, these factors may impair post-exercise recovery and subsequent performance, and may also negatively influence long-term adherence to RT.KEY POINTS This scoping review identified three broad themes of studies investigating proximity-to-failure in RT, based on the specific definition of set failure used (and therefore the research question being examined), to improve the validity of study comparisons and interpretations.There is no consensus definition for set failure in RT, and the proximity-to-failure achieved during non-failure RT is often unclear and varies both within and between studies, which together poses challenges when interpreting study findings and deriving practical recommendations regarding the influence of RT proximity-to-failure on muscle hypertrophy and other short-term responses.Based on the limited available evidence, performing RT to set failure is likely not superior to non-failure RT to maximise muscle hypertrophy, but the optimal proximity to failure in RT for muscle hypertrophy is unclear and may be moderated by other RT variables (e.g., load, volume-load). Also, RT performed to set failure likely induces greater neuromuscular fatigue, muscle damage, and perceived discomfort than non-failure RT, which may negatively influence RT performance, post-RT recovery, and long-term adherence.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study examined the influence of proximity-to-failure in resistance training (RT), using subjective repetitions-in-reserve (RIR) prediction, on neuromuscular fatigue and perceptual responses. METHODS: Twenty-four resistance-trained males (n\,=\,12) and females (n\,=\,12) completed three experimental trials in a randomised order, each involving six RT sets (barbell bench press) with 75\% 1-RM performed to either momentary muscular failure (FAIL), 1-RIR, or 3-RIR. Changes in lifting velocity with a fixed load were assessed from pre-exercise to post-exercise with the aim of quantifying acute neuromuscular fatigue (4 min post-exercise) and the associated time course of recovery (24 and 48 h post-exercise), and from the first to final set performed. Perceptual responses to RT were assessed at multiple time points during and following RT. RESULTS: Decreases in lifting velocity at 4 min post-exercise were greater for FAIL (\,-\,25\%) versus 1-RIR (\,-\,13\%) and 3-RIR (\,-\,8\%), with greater decreases for male (\,-\,29\%) versus female (\,-\,21\%) participants following FAIL. At 24 h post-exercise, decreases in lifting velocity were greater for FAIL (\,-\,3\%) and 1-RIR (\,-\,3\%) versus 3-RIR (+\,2\%), with all between-protocol differences diminishing at 48 h post-exercise. Loss of lifting velocity from the first to final set was greater for FAIL (\,-\,22\%) versus 1-RIR (\,-\,9\%) and 3-RIR (\,-\,6\%), with a greater lifting velocity loss from the first to final set for males (\,-\,15\%) versus females (\,-\,9\%). As proximity-to-failure neared, ratings of perceived discomfort, exertion, and muscle soreness increased, general feelings worsened, and perceived recovery decreased. CONCLUSION: These findings support a linear relationship between RT proximity-to-failure and both acute neuromuscular fatigue and negative perceptual responses, which may influence long-term physiological adaptations and adherence to RT.},

To achieve this, we present a novel account of kinds and classification (the Grounded Functionality Account), discuss examples from biological classification where non-epistemic values play decisive roles, and show how this account accommodates the role of non-epistemic values.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a cognitive-energetical framework for the analysis of effects of stress and high workload on human performance. Following Kahneman's (1973) model, regulation of goals and actions is assumed to require the operation of a compensatory control mechanism, which allocates resources dynamically. A two-level compensatory control model provides the basis for a mechanism of resource allocation through an effort monitor, sensitive to changes in the level of regulatory activity, coupled with a supervisory controller which can implement different modes of performance-cost trade-off. Performance may be protected under stress by the recruitment of further resources, but only at the expense of increased subjective effort, and behavioural and physiological costs. Alternatively, stability can be achieved by reducing performance goals, without further costs. Predictions about patterns of latent decrement under performance protection are evaluated in relation to the human performance literature. Even where no primary task decrements may be detected, performance may show disruption of subsidiary activities or the use of less efficient strategies, as well as increased psychophysiological activation, strain, and fatigue after-effects. Finally, the paper discusses implications of the model for the assessment of work strain, with a focus on individual-level patterns of regulatory activity and coping.},

Following the lecture, Coach Educator (CE) joins two group members for a coffee to listen to their thoughts, experiences, and coaching practices in relation to pertinent player learning theory. Behaviourist Coach (BC) discusses his approach to coaching and how he has come to coach in this way; and his practices that conform to behaviourist learning theory. When BC has finished sharing his views and practices, CE then invites the other student to contribute to the discussion. Constructivist Coach (CC) recognises that his philosophical beliefs about the facilitation of player learning are vastly different to those of BC. As such, CC decides to share his approach to coaching, which aligns itself with constructivist learning theory. It is hoped that this dialogue will not only further theorise the facilitation of player learning, but do so in a way that helps coaching practitioners make the connection between learning theory and coaching practice.},

Much of the pre-clinical rodent and human resistance training research to date supports that involved mechanisms include enhanced mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, an expansion in translational capacity through ribosome biogenesis, increased satellite cell abundance and myonuclear accretion, and post-exercise elevations in muscle protein synthesis rates. However, several lines of past and emerging evidence suggest additional mechanisms that feed into or are independent of these processes are also involved. This review will first provide a historical account as to how mechanistic research into skeletal muscle hypertrophy has progressed. A comprehensive list of mechanisms associated with skeletal muscle hypertrophy is then outlined and areas of disagreement involving these mechanisms are presented. Finally, future research directions involving many of the discussed mechanisms will be proposed.},

  abstract = {In recent years, a growing chorus of researchers has argued that psychological theory is in a state of crisis: Theories are rarely developed in a way that indicates an accumulation of knowledge. Paul Meehl raised this very concern more than 40 years ago. Yet in the ensuing decades, little has improved. We aim to chart a better path forward for psychological theory by revisiting Meehl's criticisms, his proposed solution, and the reasons his solution failed to meaningfully change the status of psychological theory. We argue that Meehl identified serious shortcomings in our evaluation of psychological theories and that his proposed solution would substantially strengthen theory testing. However, we also argue that Meehl failed to provide researchers with the tools necessary to construct the kinds of rigorous theories his approach required. To advance psychological theory, we must equip researchers with tools that allow them to better generate, evaluate, and develop their theories. We argue that formal theories provide this much-needed set of tools, equipping researchers with tools for thinking, evaluating explanation, enhancing measurement, informing theory development, and promoting the collaborative construction of psychological theories.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In order to investigate the possible causes and effects of obesity in polycystic ovary syndrome resting energy expenditure, postprandial thermogenesis and insulin resistance were measured in 14 polycystic ovary syndrome subjects and in 14 controls. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of a selected group of patients was performed. PATIENTS: Seven of the PCOS subjects were obese and seven lean. Controls were individually matched for age, race, weight, body mass index (BMI) lean body mass and percentage fat. The obese, but not lean, polycystic ovary syndrome subjects had a greater waist:hip ratio than controls (median (range) obese PCOS 0.865 (0.823-0.960) vs obese control 0.804 (0.823-0.940), P less than 0.025). MEASUREMENTS: Metabolic rate was measured by continuous indirect calorimetry and insulin sensitivity was assessed by a short insulin tolerance test. RESULTS: The resting energy expenditure (REE) was similar in PCOS subjects and controls (median (range), 6796 (5489-7774) vs 6833 (4893-8492) kJ/day). REE correlated with LBM in the PCOS group (r = 0.83, P less than 0.00) and the control group (r = 0.82, P less than 0.001). Postprandial thermogenesis was reduced in polycystic ovary syndrome (obese: median 45.4 (range 33.6-100.0) vs 86.5 (67.2-109.2) kJ (P less than 0.05); lean: 79.4 (73.5-108.4) vs 89.9 (76.0-109.2) kJ (P less than 0.05). Fasting insulin (9.7 +/- 3.6 vs 4.4 +/- 0.8 mU/l, P less than 0.05) and postprandial incremental insulin rise (163 +/- 31 vs 116 +/- 15 mU/l, P less than 0.025) were higher in polycystic ovary syndrome. Insulin sensitivity was reduced in polycystic ovary syndrome (obese: median 136 (range 92-169) vs 173 (109-225) mumol/l/min (P less than 0.05); lean: 161 (138-225) vs 194 (161-253) mumol/l/min (P less than 0.05)). The reduction in insulin sensitivity correlated with the reduced postprandial thermogenesis in the polycystic ovary syndrome group (r = 0.75, P less than 0.01). CONCLUSION: These results confirm previous reports of hyperinsulinaemia and insulin resistance in polycystic ovary syndrome. Furthermore, polycystic ovary syndrome subjects have a reduced postprandial thermogenesis which is related statistically to the reduced insulin sensitivity. The decreased postprandial thermogenesis may predispose women with polycystic ovary syndrome to weight gain.},

  abstract = {Background Predictive equations are the main clinical tools for determining resting energy expenditure (REE). However, their adequate use in overweight and obese individuals is unclear. Thus, we investigated the best predictive equations for estimating REE in overweight and obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Methods Eleven analyses were performed with prediction equations (pREE) based on anthropometric parameters in 30 overweight or obese women with PCOS without other chronic diseases. The measured REE (mREE) was calculated by indirect calorimetry. The validity of the equations was investigated by comparison, accuracy and agreement tests between pREE and mREE at both the individual and group level. Results Four analyses were similar to those of mREE, and smallest mean differences were observed for the World Health Organization/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations/United Nations University (WHO/FAO/UNU) considering weight (W) [0.07 (1.13) MJ (16 [270] kcal)]. Individual accuracy was greater than 50\% for Harris and Benedict, M\"uller and Lazzer equations. The percentage of REE underestimation ranged between 16.7\% and 73.3\%, whereas higher rates of overestimation were observed in the De Luis (66.7\%) and Ireton-Jones (43.3\%) equations. Mean bias at the group level was lowest in the WHO/FAO/UNU W and WHO/FAO/UNU considering weight and height (WH), M\"uller and Lazzer equations (--2.8 to 0.5). The WHO/FAO/UNU W and WHO/FAO/UNU WH formulas were optimal in individual agreement (33.3\%). Conclusions FAO/WHO/UNU W equations may estimate the REE in overweight and obese women with PCOS. However, the low individual accuracy and agreement in relation to mREE suggest caution regarding when to use the formula to perform an individual nutritional plan.},

  abstract = {Psychological theories often invoke interactions but remain vague regarding the details. As a consequence, researchers may not know how to properly test them and may potentially run analyses that reliably return the wrong answer to their research question. We discuss three major issues regarding the prediction and interpretation of interactions. First, interactions can be removable in the sense that they appear or disappear depending on scaling decisions, with consequences for a variety of situations (e.g., binary or categorical outcomes, bounded scales with floor and ceiling effects). Second, interactions may be conceptualized as changes in slope or changes in correlations, and because these two phenomena do not necessarily coincide, researchers might draw wrong conclusions. Third, interactions may or may not be causally identified, and this determines which interpretations are valid. Researchers who remain unaware of these distinctions might accidentally analyze their data in a manner that returns the technically correct answer to the wrong question. We illustrate all issues with examples from psychology and issue recommendations for how to best address them in a productive manner.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of physical fitness and function on older adults in two programs of supervised exercise activity: resistance training and aerobic exercise. METHODS: This study is a randomized, prospective clinical trial composed of sedentary elderly people who did not have contraindications to exercise. Participants were divided into two groups: group one performed 6 exercises of resistance training twice a week, and group two participated in walking activity for 30 minutes twice a week. Functional assessment (time 0, 6 and 12 months) was measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery (time to sit or stand, gait speed, and balance), flexibility test, and the six-minute walking test. We randomly selected 96 patients: 46 in the Resistance Training Group and 50 in the Aerobic Exercise Group. In the Resistance Training Group, 46 attended the first assessment and 20 attended until the third section. In the Aerobic Exercise Group, 50 attended the first assessment and 12 attended until the third assessment. RESULTS: Mean age was 68.8 years in the Resistance Training Group and 69.1 years in the Aerobic Exercise Group. The Resistance Training Group showed improvement in the sit/stand (p = 0.022), balance with feet in a row (p = 0.039) and queued (p = 0.001). The second showed a statistical difference in speed and balance with the feet lined up and the feet together (p = 0.008; p = 0.02; and p = 0.043, respectively). Concerning flexibility, the Resistance Training Group had improvement (p = 0.001), whereas in the Aerobic Exercise Group, no significant difference was seen (p = 0.359). Both groups had improvement in the six-minute walking test, but no significant improvement was seen in the Aerobic Exercise Group (p = 0.033). CONCLUSION: Both groups showed improvement in physical fitness. No statistical difference was seen when groups was compared in the short physical performance battery, flexibility, and six-minute walking test.},

To assess whether the hormonal milieu, the body fat distribution and the insulin metabolism may affect energy consumption in these patients. METHODS: This is a monocentric observational prospective cohort study, including 109 Caucasian PCOS subjects and 31 healthy control women. (Median age PCOS 26.0\,\textpm\,9.2~years, controls 25.5\,\textpm\,8.5~years; median BMI-body mass index PCOS 26.4\,\textpm\,9.4~kg/m2, controls 27.2\,\textpm\,12.8~kg/m2). RMR was evaluated by the SenseWear Armband (SWA), a reliable and validated metabolic holter, never previously used in the PCOS population to this purpose. Hormonal assessment, insulin metabolism evaluated by HOMA-IR and OGTT, anthropometric features (BMI and WHR) were also assessed. RESULTS: Median RMR resulted similar in PCOS and control women: 1520.0\,\textpm\,248.00~kcal/day vs 1464.0\,\textpm\,332.70~kcal/day (p\,=\,0.472), even after adjusting for BMI, fat distribution, insulin metabolism parameters. RMR resulted significantly correlated with BMI, WHR, estradiol levels, SHBG, total cholesterol, triglycerides, basal glycaemia, basal insulinemia, AUC insulin 240', and HOMA. In the subgroup of patients with WHR {$>$}\,0.85, PCOS women showed a significantly lower RMR compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: The higher prevalence of obesity, which negatively influences the reproductive and general health of PCOS women, could be related to factors other than an intrinsic alteration of the RMR. Further studies are needed to clarify the possible role of the visceral fat in modulating the energy balance in PCOS. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT03132545.},

Particular attention has been given to conceptual metaphors, which are seen as essential tools for individuals to interpret and process various ideas and experiences. Within the milieu of metaphorical speech, metaphors of war have frequently been applied across a range of domains including politics, business, and sport. Within the sporting context, the notion of `Sport is War' has been discussed in relation to various football codes, baseball, and tennis. In this article, we examine this metaphor in relation to professional stage-race cycling, a sport known for its combative, tactical, and physically demanding nature. We focus specifically on cycling commentary of the 2016 Tour de France---thus recalibrating the metaphor as `Cycling is War.' Our findings show that war metaphors are prevalent in cycling commentary and are particularly useful in highlighting aspects of the sport inclusive of competition, strategy, power, teamwork, and sportsmanship. Through these categories, the cycling is war metaphor can be said to have the potential to elevate viewer engagement as well as add insight into the technicalities of the sport and expand on previous understandings of sport/war metaphors.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine if exercise referral schemes (ERSs) are associated with meaningful changes in physical activity in a large cohort of individuals throughout England, Scotland, and Wales from The National Referral Database. METHODS: Data were obtained from 5246 participants from 12 different ERSs, lasting 6-12 weeks. The preexercise referral scheme and changes from the preexercise to the postexercise referral scheme in self-reported International Physical Activity Questionnaire scores were examined. A 2-stage individual patient data meta-analysis was used to generate the effect estimates. RESULTS: For the pre-ERS metabolic equivalent (MET) minutes per week, the estimate (95\% confidence interval [CI]) was 676~MET minutes per week (539 to 812). For the change in MET minutes per week, the estimate (95\% CI) was an increase of 540~MET minutes per week (396 to 684). Changes in the total PA levels occurred as a result of increases in vigorous activity of 17 minutes (95\% CI, 9 to 24), increases in moderate activity of 29~minutes (95\% CI, 22 to 36), and reductions in sitting of -61~minutes (95\% CI, -78 to -43), though little change in walking (-5~min; 95\% CI, -14 to 5) was found. CONCLUSIONS: Most participants undergoing ERSs are already "moderately active." Changes in PA behavior associated with participation are through increased moderate to vigorous PA and reduced sitting. However, this was insufficient to change the International Physical Activity Questionnaire category, and the participants were still "moderately active."},

The aim of these schemes is to effect clinical health benefits, yet there is limited evidence of schemes' effectiveness, which could be due to the heterogeneity in design, implementation, and evaluation. Additionally, there has been no concerted effort to map program characteristics. OBJECTIVE: To understand what key delivery approaches are currently used within exercise referral schemes in England. METHODS: Across England, a total of 30 schemes with a combined total of 85,259 exercise referral scheme participants completed a Consensus on Exercise Reporting Template-guided questionnaire. The questionnaire explored program delivery, nonexercise components, and program management. RESULTS: Results found that program delivery varied, though many schemes were typically 12~weeks in length, offering participants 2 exercise sessions in a fitness gym or studio per week, using a combination of exercises. Adherence was typically measured through attendance, with nonexercise components and program management varying by scheme. CONCLUSION: This research provides a snapshot of current delivery approaches and supports the development of a large-scale mapping exercise to review further schemes across the whole of the United Kingdom in order to provide evidence of best practice and delivery approaches nationwide.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exercise referral schemes within clinical populations may offer benefits for inactive and sedentary individuals, and improve and aid treatment of specific health disorders. This systematic review aims to provide an overview, and examine the impact, of exercise referral schemes in patients with cardiovascular, mental health, and musculoskeletal disorders. This review focuses on populations within the United Kingdom (UK) only, with an aim to inform national exercise referral policies and guidelines. METHOD: Data was collected from specific sources using validated methodology through PRISMA. Systematic searches were performed using Locate, PubMed, Scopus and Pro Quest: Public Health databases. Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria set for each sub group. This included that all studies aimed to prevent, observe, or decrease ill-health relating to the disorder, participants over the age of sixteen, and health disorders and outcomes were reviewed. All studies were conducted in the UK only. RESULTS: In the 13 articles, a variety of modes and types of exercise were utilised. One-to-one supervised exercise sessions based in a gym environment were most frequently employed. Results showed that longer length schemes (20+ weeks) produced better health outcomes, and had higher adherence to physical activity prescribed, than those of shorter length (8-12~weeks). In patients referred with cardiovascular disorders, cardiovascular-related measures showed significant decreases including blood pressure. Schemes increased physical activity levels over the length of scheme for all disorders. CONCLUSION: Longer length schemes (20+ weeks) improved adherence to physical activity prescribed over the course of the scheme, and could support longer term exercise adherence upon completion, however additional research on larger samples should examine this further. An implication is that schemes currently recommended in guidelines do not tailor programmes to support long term adherence to exercise, which must be addressed. There is currently a lack of research examining programmes tailored to suit the individual's health conditions thus further research might allow providers to tailor delivery and build upon policy recommendations in the UK.},

  abstract = {This article presents a methodological critique of the predominant research paradigms in modern social psychology, particularly social cognition, taking the approach of Solomon Asch as a more appropriate model. The critique has 2 parts. First, the dominant model of science in the field is appropriate only for a well-developed science, in which basic, real-world phenomena have been identified, important invariances in these phenomena have been documented, and appropriate model systems that capture the essence of these phenomena have been developed. These requirements are not met for most of the phenomena under study in social psychology. Second, the model of science in use is a caricature of the actual scientific process in well-developed sciences such as biology. Such research is often not model or even hypothesis driven, but rather relies on ``informed curiosity'' to motivate research. Descriptive studies are considered important and make up a substantial part of the literature, and there is less exclusive reliance on experiment. The two parts of the critique are documented by analysis of articles in appropriate psychology and biology journals. The author acknowledges that important and high quality work is currently being done in social psychology, but believes that the field has maladaptively narrowed the range of the phenomena and methodological approaches that it deems acceptable or optimal.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recently there has been interest in using subjective ratings as a measure of perceived effort during speech recognition in noise. Perceived effort may be an indicator of cognitive load. Thus, subjective effort ratings during speech recognition in noise may covary both with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and individual cognitive capacity. PURPOSE: The present study investigated the relation between subjective ratings of the effort involved in listening to speech in noise, speech recognition performance, and individual working memory (WM) capacity in hearing impaired hearing aid users. RESEARCH DESIGN: In two experiments, participants with hearing loss rated perceived effort during aided speech perception in noise. Noise type and SNR were manipulated in both experiments, and in the second experiment hearing aid compression release settings were also manipulated. Speech recognition performance was measured along with WM capacity. STUDY SAMPLE: There were 46 participants in all with bilateral mild to moderate sloping hearing loss. In Experiment 1 there were 16 native Danish speakers (eight women and eight men) with a mean age of 63.5 yr (SD{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}12.1) and average pure tone (PT) threshold of 47. 6 dB (SD{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}9.8). In Experiment 2 there were 30 native Swedish speakers (19 women and 11 men) with a mean age of 70 yr (SD{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}7.8) and average PT threshold of 45.8 dB (SD{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}6.6). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A visual analog scale (VAS) was used for effort rating in both experiments. In Experiment 1, effort was rated at individually adapted SNRs while in Experiment 2 it was rated at fixed SNRs. Speech recognition in noise performance was measured using adaptive procedures in both experiments with Dantale II sentences in Experiment 1 and Hagerman sentences in Experiment 2. WM capacity was measured using a letter-monitoring task in Experiment 1 and the reading span task in Experiment 2. RESULTS: In both experiments, there was a strong and significant relation between rated effort and SNR that was independent of individual WM capacity, whereas the relation between rated effort and noise type seemed to be influenced by individual WM capacity. Experiment 2 showed that hearing aid compression setting influenced rated effort. CONCLUSIONS: Subjective ratings of the effort involved in speech recognition in noise reflect SNRs, and individual cognitive capacity seems to influence relative rating of noise type.},

Ss who possessed high pre- and postexercise efficacy reported lower perceptions of effort and physical strain during exercise compared to less efficacious Ss. Furthermore, the relationship between efficacy and perceptions of effort might even be stronger at exercise intensities above 60\% VO{$_2$}max as efficacy cognitions are hypothesized to be most influential when tasks are difficult.

SETTING: Aerobics centre longitudinal study. PARTICIPANTS: 8762 men aged 20-80. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: All cause mortality up to 31 December 2003; muscular strength, quantified by combining one repetition maximal measures for leg and bench presses and further categorised as age specific thirds of the combined strength variable; and cardiorespiratory fitness assessed by a maximal exercise test on a treadmill. RESULTS: During an average follow-up of 18.9 years, 503 deaths occurred (145 cardiovascular disease, 199 cancer). Age adjusted death rates per 10,000 person years across incremental thirds of muscular strength were 38.9, 25.9, and 26.6 for all causes; 12.1, 7.6, and 6.6 for cardiovascular disease; and 6.1, 4.9, and 4.2 for cancer (all P{$<$}0.01 for linear trend). After adjusting for age, physical activity, smoking, alcohol intake, body mass index, baseline medical conditions, and family history of cardiovascular disease, hazard ratios across incremental thirds of muscular strength for all cause mortality were 1.0 (referent), 0.72 (95\% confidence interval 0.58 to 0.90), and 0.77 (0.62 to 0.96); for death from cardiovascular disease were 1.0 (referent), 0.74 (0.50 to 1.10), and 0.71 (0.47 to 1.07); and for death from cancer were 1.0 (referent), 0.72 (0.51 to 1.00), and 0.68 (0.48 to 0.97). The pattern of the association between muscular strength and death from all causes and cancer persisted after further adjustment for cardiorespiratory fitness; however, the association between muscular strength and death from cardiovascular disease was attenuated after further adjustment for cardiorespiratory fitness. CONCLUSION: Muscular strength is inversely and independently associated with death from all causes and cancer in men, even after adjusting for cardiorespiratory fitness and other potential confounders.},

  abstract = {Bodybuilding is a sport where coaches commonly recommend a variety of nutrition and exercise protocols, supplements, and, sometimes, performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). The present study sought to gain an understanding of the common decisions and rationales employed by bodybuilding coaches. Focusing on coaches of the more muscular divisions in the National Physique Committee/IFBB Professional League federations (men's classic physique, men's bodybuilding, women's physique, women's bodybuilding) for both natural and enhanced athletes, coaches were recruited via word of mouth and social media, and 33 responded to an anonymous online survey. Survey responses indicated that participant coaches recommend three-to-seven meals per day and no less than 2 g/kg/day of protein regardless of sex, division, or PED usage. During contest preparation, participant coaches alter a natural competitor's protein intake by -25\% to +10\% and an enhanced competitor's protein intake by 0\% to +25\%. Regarding cardiovascular exercise protocols, approximately two-thirds of participant coaches recommend fasted cardiovascular exercise, with the common rationale of combining the exercise with thermogenic supplements while considering the athlete's preference. Low- and moderate-intensity steady state were the most commonly recommended types of cardiovascular exercise among participant coaches; high-intensity interval training was the least popular. Creatine was ranked in the top two supplements for all surveyed categories. Regarding PEDs, testosterone, growth hormone, and methenolone were consistently ranked in the top five recommended PEDs by participant coaches. The results of this study provide insight into common themes in the decisions made by bodybuilding coaches, and highlight areas in which more research is needed to empirically support those decisions.},

Therefore, accurately estimating BMR is critical for developing rigorous obesity prevention and control strategies.

A comprehensive literature search revealed 248 BMR estimation equations developed using diverse ranges of age, gender, race, fat-free mass, fat mass, height, waist-to-hip ratio, body mass index and weight. A subset of 47 studies included enough detail to allow for development of meta-regression equations. Utilizing these studies, meta-equations were developed targeted to 20 specific population groups. This review provides a comprehensive summary of available BMR equations and an estimate of their accuracy. An accompanying online BMR prediction tool (available at http://www.sdl.ise.vt.edu/tutorials.html) was developed to automatically estimate BMR based on the most appropriate equation after user-entry of individual age, race, gender and weight.},

  abstract = {The psychometrically sound development of assessment instruments requires pilot testing of candidate items as a first step in gauging their quality, typically a time-consuming and costly effort. Crowdsourcing offers the opportunity for gathering data much more quickly and inexpensively than from most targeted populations. In a simulation of a pilot testing protocol, item parameters for 110 life science questions are estimated from 4,043 crowdsourced adult subjects and then compared with those from 20,937 middle school science students. In terms of item discrimination classification (high vs. low), classical test theory yields an acceptable level of agreement (C-statistic = 0.755); item response theory produces excellent results (C-statistic = 0.848). Item response theory also identifies potential anchor items without including any false positives (items with low discrimination in the targeted population). We conclude that the use of crowdsourcing subjects is a reasonable, efficient method for the identification of high-quality items for field testing and for the selection of anchor items to be used for test equating.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The benefits of aerobic exercise are well-studied; there is no consensus on the association between resistance training and major adverse cardiovascular outcomes. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to address this issue. DESIGN AND METHODS: We searched for randomized trials and cohort studies that evaluated the association between resistance training and mortality and cardiovascular events. Two investigators screened the identified abstracts and full-texts independently and in duplicate. Cochrane tools were used to assess the risk of bias. We calculated hazard ratios and 95\% confidence intervals using random effect models. RESULTS: From the 1430 studies identified, 11 (one randomized trial and 10 cohort studies) met the inclusion criteria, totaling 370,256 participants with mean follow-up of 8.85 years. The meta-analysis showed that, compared with no exercise, resistance training was associated with 21\% (hazard ratio (95\% confidence interval (CI)), 0.79 (0.69-0.91)) and 40\% (hazard ratio (95\% CI), 0.60 (0.49-0.72)) lower all-cause mortality alone and when combined with aerobic exercise, respectively. Furthermore, resistance training had a borderline association with lower cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio (95\% CI), 0.83 (0.67-1.03)). In addition, resistance training showed no significant association with cancer mortality. Risk of bias was low to intermediate in the included studies. One cohort study looked at the effect of resistance training on coronary heart disease events in men and found a 23\% risk reduction (risk ratio, 0.77, CI: 0.61-0.98). CONCLUSION: Resistance training is associated with lower mortality and appears to have an additive effect when combined with aerobic exercise. There are insufficient data to determine the potential beneficial effect of resistance training on non-fatal events or the effect of substituting aerobic exercise with resistance training.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most common metabolic disorder among women of reproductive age. Many factors are involved in the development of PCOS, among which genetic predisposition is probably the main contributor that is also influenced by lifestyle and environmental factors. This study aims to determine the prevalence of PCOS in different continents based on Rotterdam, AES and NIH diagnostic criteria. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the prevalence of polycystic ovary syndrome in women according to (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) PRISMA guidelines. PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science and Google Scholar databases were comprehensively searched until February 2021 for relevant articles. Heterogeneity between the studies was assessed using the I2 index. Begg and Mazumdar's test was used to evaluate publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 35 studies with 12,365,646 subjects were retrieved. The mean age ranged from 10-45~years. Global prevalence of PCOS was 9.2\% (95\% CI: 6.8-12.5\%) based on meta-analysis, our results showed that the global prevalence of PCOS was 5.5\% (95\% CI: 3.9-7.7\%) based on NIH criteria, 11.5 (95\% CI: 6.6-19.4) based on Rotterdam criteria, and 7.1\% (95\% CI: 2.3-20.2\%) based on AES criteria. According to self-report subgroup analysis, the prevalence of PCOS was found to be 11\% (95\% CI: 5.2-21.8\%). CONCLUSION: Based on the results of the present study, the prevalence of PCOS in the world was 9.2\% (95\% CI: 6.8-12.5\%). According to the results of the present study and the high prevalence of PCOS, especially in the Africa continent, it is necessary for health systems to implement measures to timely prevent and treat this syndrome.},

Resistance training performed to failure or not to failure results in similar total volume, but with different fatigue and discomfort levels. J Strength Cond Res 35(5): 1372-1379, 2021-The purpose of this study was to compare the acute response to 4 sets of high velocity parallel squats performed to momentary failure (MF) or not to momentary failure (NF). Twelve women (24.93 \textpm{} 5.04 years) performed MF and NF protocols, in a randomized order with 2-3 interday rest. The protocol involved 4 sets of parallel squats executed at high velocity at 10RM load, with 2 minutes of rest interval between sets. During the NF protocol, the sets were interrupted when the subject lost more than 20\% of mean propulsive velocity. The analysis involved the number of repetitions performed per set, total number of repetitions, movement velocity loss, power output loss, rating of perceived exertion (RPE), rating of perceived discomfort (RPD), and session rating of perceived exertion (sRPE). Compared with NF, MF resulted in a higher number of repetitions in the first set (11.58 \textpm{} 1.83 vs. 7.58 \textpm{} 1.72, p {$<$} 0.05), but a lower in the last set (3.58 \textpm{} 1.08 vs. 5.41 \textpm{} 1.08, p {$<$} 0.05). Total number of repetitions was similar between the protocols (MF 26.25 \textpm{} 3.47 vs. NF 24.5 \textpm{} 3.65, p {$>$} 0.05). In both protocols, there were significant decreases in maximum and mean movement velocity loss and power output loss, but higher decreases were observed in MF than NF (p {$<$} 0.05). Values for RPE, sRPE, and RPD were higher during MF than NF (p {$<$} 0.05). Controlling the movement velocity in NF protocol enabled performance of a similar total volume of repetitions with lower movement velocity and power output losses, RPE, sRPE, and RPD than during an MF protocol.},

Seventy-eight boys (M age = 13.6 years) performed five climbing courses, and the influence of achievement goals, perceived ability, and task difficulty on effort and performance was studied. According to the achievement goal theory: (a) task-involved boys exerted more effort and performed better than ego-involved boys; and (b) exerted effort was determined by an interaction of one's achievement goal, perceived ability (PA), and task difficulty. Ego-high PA boys and task-low PA boys exerted the most effort on the moderate course; ego-low PA boys exerted least effort on the moderate and very difficult courses. Finally, task-high PA boys exerted more effort on the most difficult courses. The motivational processes underlying these findings are discussed.},

Thirty-two non-resistance trained young adults were randomly assigned to one of the three groups: extended joint training (0\textopenbullet --50\textopenbullet; EXT, n = 12); flexed joint training (80\textopenbullet --130\textopenbullet; FLE, n = 12); and non-training control (n = 8). The exercise training was performed by the dominant arms twice a week for 5 weeks with gradual increases in the training volume over 10 training sessions, and the non-dominant (non-trained) arms were investigated for the cross-education effect. Maximal voluntary contraction torque of isometric (MVC-ISO), concentric (MVC-CON), and eccentric contractions (MVC-ECC), and thickness (MT) of biceps brachii and brachialis of the trained and non-trained arms were assessed at baseline and 4--8 days after the last training session. The control group did not show significant changes in any variables. Significant (P {$<$} 0.05) increases in MVCISO torque (16.2 \textpm{} 12.6\%), MVC-CON torque (21.1 \textpm{} 24.4\%), and MVC-ECC torque (19.6 \textpm{} 17.5\%) of the trained arm were observed for the EXT group only. The magnitude of the increase in MT of the trained arm was greater (P {$<$} 0.05) for EXT (8.9 \textpm{} 3.9\%) than FLE (3.4 \textpm{} 2.7\%). The cross-education effect was evident for MVC-ISO (15.9 \textpm{} 14.8\%) and MVC-CON (16.7 \textpm{} 20.0\%) torque of the EXT group only. These results suggest that resistance training at the extended elbow joint induces greater muscle adaptations and cross-education effects than that at flexed elbow joint.},

  abstract = {There has been a remarkable push for the use of positionality statements---also known as reflexivity statements---in scientific-journal articles and other research literatures. Grounded in reputable philosophical traditions, positionality statements are meant to address genuine concerns about the limits of knowledge production. However, there are at least three reasons why they should be avoided in scholarship. First, it is impossible to construct credible positionality statements because they are constrained by the very positionality they seek to address. Second, positionality statements are unnecessary because reducing bias---positional or otherwise---in scientific literatures does not hinge on the biographical details of individual scholars but on the integrity of the collective process of truth-seeking. Third, by asking scholars to disclose information about themselves, positionality statements undermine the very norms and practices that safeguard the impartiality of research. Instead of asking individual scholars to issue subjective declarations about their positionalities, scholarly communities should focus on improving the rules of intersubjective competition at the heart of scientific progress. In our view, the most productive path to increasing representation and reducing positional bias in research is to protect the freedom of scholarly inputs while insisting on methodological transparency and rigor.},

METHODS: 42 older men and women (71.3~\textpm ~6.6 years) were randomized to lower extremity HSPT (n~=~28) or control (CON; n~=~14) (Analysis 1) for 12~weeks. A second analysis (Analysis 2) allocated HSPT into high-velocity (n~=~14) or low-velocity (n~=~14) based on a limb movement speed above or below the median average velocity during the 12-week HSPT intervention. Habitual gait speed, maximal gait speed, timed up-and-go, and the short physical performance battery were measured at baseline and 12~weeks. Change scores were compared between HSPT and CON (Analysis 1), and high-velocity, low-velocity, and CON (Analysis 2) using ANCOVA. Statistical significance was accepted at p~{$<~$}0.05. RESULTS: Analysis 1 There were no group differences in habitual gait speed, maximal gait speed, or timed up-and-go between HSPT and CON (all p~{$>~$}0.05). Short physical performance battery was greater in HSPT (0.96~\textpm ~0.19) compared to CON (0.10~\textpm ~0.26; p~=~0.01). Analysis 2 There were no group differences in the change in habitual GS (p~=~0.33) among high-velocity, low-velocity and CON. There were significant group differences in the change in maximal GS (p~=~0.007), timed up-and-go (p~=~0.03), and short physical performance battery (p~=~0.03). CONCLUSIONS: There is considerable variation in self-selected maximal limb velocity during HSPT in older adults. In the present cohort, an average limb velocity of 0.88~m/s during HSPT was necessary to ensure optimal improvement in functional performance for older adults, but this threshold will need further investigation.},

Therefore, in this study we aimed to investigate the effects of a novel, four-week, gymnastic-specific, eccentric--isokinetic (0.1 m/s) cluster training on a computer-controlled training device on the improvement of two static strength elements on rings (swallow and support scale). Nine elite male gymnasts participated in this study. Outcome parameters were maximum strength and strength endurance in maintaining the static position of both elements. After four weeks of training, specific maximum strength increased significantly (swallow: +4.1\%; d = 0.85; p = 0.01; support scale: +3.6\%; d = 2.47; p = 0.0002) and strength endurance tended to improve (swallow: +104.8\%; d = 0.60; p = 0.07; support scale: +26.8\%; d = 0.27; p = 0.19). Our results demonstrate that top athletes can considerably improve ring-specific strength and strength endurance in only four weeks. We assumed that the high specificity but also the unfamiliar stimulus of slow eccentric movements with very long times under maximal muscle tension led to these improvements. We suggest to use this type of training periodically and during phases in which the technical training load is low.},

Participants were tested before and after a 4-week control period and then assigned to a 12-week HVRT intervention. Investigated outcomes included ultrasound-derived muscle thickness and quality, maximal dynamic strength (1RM), maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC), and muscle activation (sEMG), as well as muscle power and functional performance. After the intervention, quadriceps muscle thickness, 1RM, and sEMG improved in all three groups (all p\,{$<$}\,0.05), whereas muscle quality improved only in middle-aged and older participants (p\,{$\leq$}\,0.001), and MVIC only in middle-aged and mobility-limited older adults (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). With a few exceptions, peak power improved in all groups from 30-90\% 1RM (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) both when tested relative to pre-training or post-training 1RM workloads (all p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Both mobility-limited older adults and older adults improved their short physical performance battery score (p\,{$<$}\,0.05). Chair stand, stair climb, maximal gait speed, and timed up-and-go performance, on the other hand, improved in all three groups (p\,{$<$}\,0.05), but no change was observed for habitual gait speed and 6-min walk test performance. Overall, our results demonstrate that a HVRT intervention can build a stronger foundation in middle-aged individuals so that they can better deal with age-related impairments at the same time that it can mitigate already present physiological and functional impairments in older adults with and without mobility-limitation.},

Twelve strength-training-naive subjects performed two sets of 10 repetitions for six lower body exercises while 12 subjects served as nonintervention controls. Subjects were tested pre-, mid-, and postintervention for strength gain and on three tests of functional ability. RESULTS: Postintervention strength was significantly better (p {$<$}.017) in all training subjects across all exercises, and no injuries were reported as a result of either training or 1RM testing. After controlling for preintervention differences, repeated measure analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) found a significant difference between experimental and nonintervention control subjects for postintervention maximal walking speed [F(1,19) = 5.03, p {$<$}.05]. There were no significant between-group differences for 1-leg blind balance time or 5-repetition sit-to-stand performance [F(1,19) =.082; F(1,19) =.068, respectively, p {$>$}.05]. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that strength training alone does not appear to enhance standing balance or sit-to-stand performance in active, community-dwelling older adults but that it may improve maximal walking speed. The relationship between strength gain and risk of falls remains unclear. The data do reinforce the notion that intense strength training is a safe and effective way to increase muscle strength in this population.},

Based on the available literature, we aimed to draw evidence-based recommendations for RT prescription. Six studies were identified as meeting inclusion criteria: four of these studies involved RT for the lower limbs while the other two focused on the upper extremities. The total combined sample of the studies was n\,=\,135, which comprised 127 men and 8 women. The methodological quality of all included studies was deemed to be "excellent" based on the modified PEDro scale. When assessing the current body of literature, it can be inferred that performing RT through a full ROM confers beneficial effects on hypertrophy of the lower body musculature versus training with a partial ROM. Alternatively, research on the effects of ROM for the upper limbs is limited and conflicting, precluding the ability to draw strong practical inferences. No study to date has investigated how ROM influences muscle growth of the trunk musculature. Finally, some evidence indicates that the response to variations in ROM may be muscle-specific; however, this hypothesis also warrants further study.},

  author = {Scholten, Zand},
  year = 2011,
  urldate = {2023-01-18},
  abstract = {Recently, quantitative measurement in Item Response Theory was questioned because it seems based on a paradox concerning error and precision (Michell, 2008a). The Rasch model ensures interval level measurement. If precision increases in Rasch items, they become Guttman items, losing their quantitative properties. Removing error decreases precision. To address this paradox we consider to what extent both models meet the requirements for interval level measurement. This leads us to conclude that the Guttman model cannot simply be considered an error-free version of the Rasch model. Furthermore, we argue that an increase in precision by adding error is not paradoxical per se, by discussing the well-known phenomenon of stochastic resonance. These arguments together lead us to conclude that the paradox disappears when the crucial aspects of continuity and measurement level, and not error and precision, are considered. 48 4. The Guttman-Rasch Paradox in Item Response Theory 4.1 Measurement Level Difference in IRT Models There is an unusual difference in measurement level between the closely related Guttman and Rasch models in Item Response Theory (IRT). The Rasch model, a stochastic model that incorporates error, is said to yield measurement at the interval level (e.g., Wright, 1999; Bond \& Fox, 2007). A deterministic, error-free version of this model is the Guttman model (Guttman, 1950). Although this model is devoid of error, it provides measurement at the ordinal level only. It has been pointed out by various scholars that this presents us with a paradox (Duncan, 1984; Fischer, 1995; Kyngdon, 2008b). The problem is stated most eloquently by Michell, who asks: Is it not paradoxical that improving the precision of our observational conditions decreases the precision of our observations? (Michell, 2008a, p. 15, l. 5-7). In other words, one would hardly expect that removing measurement error from our procedures and instruments would hurt, rather than help measurement precision. Previous comments on this paradoxical loss of measurement level were never much more than cursory notes, until Michell (2008a, 2009) recently reintroduced the paradox to argue against the claim that the Rasch model yields interval level measurement. His objection is nicely illustrated by the following analogy. Suppose astronomers discover a new star. They think a planetary system around this star can be observed, although an obscuring haze impedes observation. Now suppose this haze suddenly disappears and observation is entirely unobstructed. If, along with the haze, the planetary system were no longer detectable, what would the astronomers conclude? Obviously the existence of the system would be considered highly doubtful, because the observation depends solely on the presence of error. By analogy, the claim that the Rasch model yields interval level measurement should be doubted, because it too disappears when our view is no longer obstructed by error (Michell, 2008a, p. 15, l. 8-19, paraphrased). This argument clearly demonstrates a deep concern regarding the merit of measurement claims in psychometrics and psychology in general. We share this concern. The assertion of interval level measurement is anything but trivial. It involves assumptions and restrictions that far too often remain implicit and untested. Objections to such claims, when based on lack of empirical verification or blind acceptance of shaky assumptions, need to be addressed. In this context the Guttman-Rasch paradox clearly demands 4.1. Measurement Level Difference in IRT Models 49 our attention. It is important with respect to the status of commonly used measurement models, and by extension to the status of applications of psychological measurement in society at large. We therefore hope to answer two questions that naturally follow from the renewed interest in the Guttman-Rasch paradox. First, does the paradox indeed have merit as an argument against the claim of interval level measurement by the Rasch model? Second, is the change in measurement level truly paradoxical? Both questions will be answered with a resounding `no'. To be clear, the goal is not to argue in support of the claim of interval level measurement by the Rasch model. Instead, we show that the paradox is irrelevant to the discussion. The recent characterization of the Guttman-Rasch paradox does not contribute constructively to the debate on the status of measurement pretensions associated with psychological models and measurement procedures. The paradox, as presented above, paints a grossly oversimplified picture of the relation between the Guttman and Rasch models and the relation between measurement level and measurement precision in general. We consider how the argument that employs the paradox is structured and show why this argument is flawed. From this we will see that the paradox itself is an illusion, fostered primarily by ill-chosen formulation. The difference in measurement level between the Guttman and Rasch models is in fact entirely non-paradoxical (see also Sijtsma, 2011 for another approach leading to the same conclusion). The argument, as we believe it to be generally understood, consists of the following propositions: 1. The Guttman model yields ordinal measurement; 2. The Rasch model yields interval measurement; 3. The only difference between the models is error, and: 4. Removal of error cannot decrease measurement precision. This last proposition is false when we apply it to the Guttman-Rasch paradox; precision does decrease when we remove error from the Rasch model and are left with the ordinal Guttman model. Therefore scholars like Michell conclude that the second proposition (i.e. the Rasch model yields interval measurement) is false. To show where this argument fails and to better 50 4. The Guttman-Rasch Paradox in Item Response Theory understand the paradox itself, the validity of each of these propositions will be discussed. Before we can turn to the first two propositions that assert the measurement pretensions of the Guttman and Rasch model however, we need to introduce these two models in more detail. 4.2 Guttman and Rasch The Guttman and Rasch models are closely related Item Response Theory (IRT) models. IRT is commonly accepted as an improvement over Classical Test Theory (CTT). With IRT we can, for instance, equate tests, investigate item bias, and develop computer adaptive tests. Conceptually, IRT models differ from CTT in two major respects. First, they assume that participant responses to each item of a test can be related to an underlying trait or latent variable. This variable could be a preference, attitude, ability or personality trait, such as paranoia. Both items and participants are assumed to be comparable on the same underlying, one-dimensional continuum reflecting this variable. When a participant `dominates' an item, we would expect the participant to answer the item correctly or to endorse it. For example, a very paranoid person is expected to endorse the item ``I often think people talk about me behind my back''. Second, IRT models explicitly specify the relation between the latent variable and the chance of endorsing an item. Different IRT models assume different relational forms. Models can be deterministic or stochastic, discrete or continuous, linear or non-linear. Table 4.1: Typical probability patterns for the Guttman and Rasch model (a) Guttman model probabilities},

Traditional approaches to a science of values would be likely to reify historically specific and context-dependent phenomena into timeless generalizations that may then take on a normative force, shaping social life and institutions. An illuminating and useful science of values must include a critical examination of history and culture.

All groups were matched with respect to age and fat-free mass and the two obese groups were matched for degree of obesity. RMR was measured by indirect calorimetry for 3 h on two days: (1) in the postabsorptive state; and (2) after a 720 kcal (3014 kJ) liquid mixed meal. The thermic effect of food, calculated as 3 h postprandial minus fasting RMR, was significantly greater for the lean [52.9 +/- 5.5 kcal/3 h (221 +/- 23 kJ/3 h)] than the obese [17.2 +/- 5.1 kcal/3 h (72 +/- 21 kJ/3 h)] and the PCO women [22.8 +/- 5.2 kcal/3 h (95 +/- 22 kJ/3)], P less than 0.001). The thermic effect of food was negatively related to percent body fat (r = -0.694, P less than 0.001). Resting metabolic rate did not differ significantly among the three groups, and was strongly related to fat-free mass (r = 0.687, P less than 0.001). These results confirm previous reports of blunted thermogenesis in obese individuals, but provide no evidence of altered resting metabolic rate or postprandial thermogenesis in women with PCO compared with normal women of similar degree of obesity.},

  abstract = {Glazier's suggestion for the constraints-led approach as a GUT for sport performance is a worthy proposal. What is missing from these preliminary insights is a principled basis, in the form of pillars, for understanding the cornerstones of the sports medicine profession, and this lack of an overarching theoretical framework is also somewhat of a limitation in Glazier's initial ideas, as we argue later. Here we suggest that his preliminary proposal would benefit from considering a more comprehensive ontological positioning within the complexity sciences paradigm to benefit from conceptualising athletes and sports teams as complex adaptive systems. We argue that ecological dynamics provides a more encompassing rationale than the constraint-led approach because it is a multi-dimensional theoretical framework shaped by many relevant disciplines.},

  abstract = {Meta-analyses are often used to estimate the relative average values of a quantitative outcome in two groups (eg, control and experimental groups). However, they may also examine the relative variability (variance) of those groups. For such comparisons, two relatively new effect size statistics, the log-transformed "variability ratio" (the ratio of two standard deviations; lnVR) and the log-transformed "coefficients of variation ratio" (the ratio of two coefficients of variation; lnCVR) are useful. In practice, lnCVR may be of most use because a treatment may affect the mean and the variance simultaneously. We propose new estimators for lnCVR and lnVR, including for when the two groups are dependent (eg, cross-over and pre-test-post-test designs). Through simulation, we evaluated the bias of these estimators and make recommendations accordingly. We use the methods to demonstrate that: (a) lifestyle interventions have a heterogenizing effect on gestational weight gain in obese women and (b) low-glycemic index (GI) diets have a homogenizing effect on glycemic control in diabetics. We also find that the degree to which dependence among samples is accounted for can impact parameters such as {$\tau$}2 (ie, the between-study variance) and I2 (ie, the proportion of the total variability due to between-study variance), and even the overall effect, and associated qualitative interpretations. Meta-analytic comparison of the variability between two groups enables us to ask completely new questions and to gain fresh insights from existing datasets. We encourage researchers to take advantage of these convenient new effect size measures for the meta-analysis of variation.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the relationship between resistance training and all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer mortality. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews Registration Number CRD42019136654) was conducted. MEDLINE (OVID), Embase, Emcare, SPORTDiscus, The Cochrane Library, and SCOPUS were searched from inception to June 6, 2021. Included studies reported resistance training as the exposure and all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease-specific mortality, and/or cancer-specific mortality as outcome/s. Only studies conducted among nonclinical adult populations (aged {$\geq$}18 years) and written in English were included. RESULTS: A total of 10 studies were included in the meta-analyses. Compared with undertaking no resistance training, undertaking any amount of resistance training reduced the risk of all-cause mortality by 15\% (RR of 6 studies=0.85; 95\% CI=0.77, 0.93), cardiovascular disease mortality by 19\% (RR of 4 studies=0.81; 95\% CI=0.66, 1.00), and cancer mortality by 14\% (RR of 5 studies=0.86; 95\% CI=0.78, 0.95). A dose-response meta-analysis of 4 studies suggested a nonlinear relationship between resistance training and the risk of all-cause mortality. A maximum risk reduction of 27\% was observed at around 60 minutes per week of resistance training (RR=0.74; 95\% CI=0.64, 0.86). Mortality risk reductions diminished at higher volumes. DISCUSSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis provides the strongest evidence to date that resistance training is associated with reduced risk of all-cause, cardiovascular disease, and cancer-specific mortality. More research is needed to determine whether any potential mortality benefits gained from resistance training diminish at higher volumes.},

One hundred twenty-four Norwegian powerlifters completed an electronic questionnaire that surveyed their current training practices with a focus on 2 areas: (a) training content and (b) training design and monitoring. One hundred seventeen respondents met the inclusion criteria, and the sample included World, European, and Norwegian champions. Where data were dichotomized, chi-square tests were used. The most frequently reported (58.1\%) category of training was 5-6 times per week, with no statistically significant associations between levels of competitors (international vs. noninternational) (X 2 (1) = 0.414, p = 0.52). The most frequently reported load used in training was 71-80\% 1 repetition maximum. The majority of Norwegian (76.9\%) powerlifters train with variable resistance, with those competing internationally more likely to use elastic bands (X 2 (1) = 4.473, p = 0.034). 32.5\% of respondents reported that they included strength training exercises in their training. Norwegian powerlifters' training differs from practices previously identified in the literature, with a higher prevalence of elastic resistance, particularly for those competing internationally, and a decreased use of strength training exercises at all levels. Norwegian powerlifters train frequently (5 or more times per week) and with submaximal loads.},

While this distinction has been recognized in the philosophy of science, the statistical literature lacks a thorough discussion of the many differences that arise in the process of modeling for an explanatory versus a predictive goal.

SUBJECTS: Fifteen older adults with no history of falls (mean age=78 years, SD=6, range=65-85) and 15 older adults with a history of 2 or more falls in the previous 6 months (mean age=86.2 years, SD=6, range=76-95) participated. METHODS: Time taken to complete the TUG under 3 conditions (TUG, TUG with a subtraction task [TUGcognitive], and TUG while carrying a full cup of water [TUGmanual]) was measured. A multivariate analysis of variance and discriminant function and logistic regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: The TUG was found to be a sensitive (sensitivity=87\%) and specific (specificity=87\%) measure for identifying elderly individuals who are prone to falls. For both groups of older adults, simultaneous performance of an additional task increased the time taken to complete the TUG, with the greatest effect in the older adults with a history of falls. The TUG scores with or without an additional task (cognitive or manual) were equivalent with respect to identifying fallers and nonfallers. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION: The results suggest that the TUG is a sensitive and specific measure for identifying community-dwelling adults who are at risk for falls. The ability to predict falls is not enhanced by adding a secondary task when performing the TUG.},

Before and after the training period, the participants performed a 10-repetition maximum (10RM) test for knee extension, an incremental exercise test on a treadmill for time to exhaustion (TTE) and peak oxygen consumption (V˙O2peak) and underwent dual energy X-ray absorptiometry to assess lower limb composition. Knee extension 10RM and TTE increased in both groups with no statistically significant between group (p =~0.614 and p =~0.210). Only cycle ergometer group increased V˙O2peak (p = 0,012). For all lower limb composition outcomes, changes were minimal.

  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  abstract = {This book presents a systematic account of the role of the personal spiritual ideal of wu-wei--literally "no doing," but better rendered as "effortless action"--in early Chinese thought. Edward Slingerland's analysis shows that wu-wei represents the most general of a set of conceptual metaphors having to do with a state of effortless ease and unself-consciousness. This concept of effortlessness, he contends, serves as a common ideal for both Daoist and Confucian thinkers. He also argues that this concept contains within itself a conceptual tension that motivates the development of early Chinese thought: the so-called "paradox of wu-wei," or the question of how one can consciously "try not to try."  Methodologically, this book represents a preliminary attempt to apply the contemporary theory of conceptual metaphor to the study of early Chinese thought. Although the focus is upon early China, both the subject matter and methodology have wider implications. The subject of wu-wei is relevant to anyone interested in later East Asian religious thought or in the so-called "virtue-ethics" tradition in the West. Moreover, the technique of conceptual metaphor analysis--along with the principle of "embodied realism" upon which it is based--provides an exciting new theoretical framework and methodological tool for the study of comparative thought, comparative religion, intellectual history, and even the humanities in general. Part of the purpose of this work is thus to help introduce scholars in the humanities and social sciences to this methodology, and provide an example of how it may be applied to a particular sub-field.},

Social psychology, and the social and behavioral sciences more generally, are replete with similar cases. This is the limitation of verbal models. The danger with most verbal models is that there are many ways to specify the parts and relationships of a system that are consistent with such a model. Scientific inquiry stalls when data is used to simply support rather than refine a verbal model. Formal models are explicit in the assumptions they make about how the parts of a system work and interact, and moreover are explicit in the aspects of reality they omit. Newton's theory of Universal Gravitation rested on a model that, to na\"ive eyes can easily appear quite stupid. This has the potential disadvantage of making formal models appear stupid. And of course, they are stupid, because of limited beings and stupid models are the best.},

  abstract = {Power analysis for first-order interactions poses two challenges: (a) Conducting an appropriate power analysis is difficult because the typical expected effect size of an interaction depends on its shape, and (b) achieving sufficient power is difficult because interactions are often modest in size. This article consists of three parts. In the first part, we address the first challenge. We first use a fictional study to explain the difference between power analyses for interactions and main effects. Then, we introduce an intuitive taxonomy of 12 types of interactions based on the shape of the interaction (reversed, fully attenuated, partially attenuated) and the size of the simple slopes (median, smaller, larger), and we offer mathematically derived sample-size recommendations to detect each interaction with a power of .80/.90/.95 (for two-tailed tests in between-participants designs). In the second part, we address the second challenge. We first describe a preregistered metastudy (159 studies from recent articles in influential psychology journals) showing that the median power to detect interactions of a typical size is .18. Then, we use simulations ({$\approx$}900,000,000 data sets) to generate power curves for the 12 types of interactions and test three approaches to increase power without increasing sample size: (a) preregistering one-tailed tests (+21\% gain), (b) using a mixed design (+75\% gain), and (c) preregistering contrast analysis for a fully attenuated interaction (+62\% gain). In the third part, we introduce INT\texttimes Power (www.intxpower.com), a web application that enables users to draw their interaction and determine the sample size needed to reach the power of their choice with the option of using/combining these approaches.},

The study aimed to use a questionnaire to compare physical activity, social trust and personal wellbeing of golfers with national statistics. Furthermore, the study aimed to measure the association between golfers' physical activity levels and self-efficacy for both golf and general exercise participation. Results demonstrated that golfers reported significantly different physical activity levels in comparison to the population of England. Golfers scored significantly higher on social trust and personal wellbeing compared to the population of the UK and England respectively. Golf and exercise self-efficacy were significantly associated with physical activity. The findings of the study demonstrate that, despite golfers having relatively lower levels of physical activity, golf participation is associated with psychological wellbeing. Implications for coaches focus on increasing awareness of the possible benefits of golf participation.},

  abstract = {Can merely thinking about an imaginary situation provide evidence for how the world actually is--or how it ought to be? In this lively book, Roy A. Sorensen addresses this question with an analysis of a wide variety of thought experiments ranging from aesthetics to zoology. Presenting the first general theory of thought experiment, he sets it within an evolutionary framework and integrates recent advances in experimental psychology and the history of science, with special emphasis on Ernst Mach and Thomas Kuhn.  Sorensen explores what thought experiments are, how they work, and what their virtues and vices are. In his view, philosophy differs from science in degree, but not in kind. For this reason, he claims, it is possible to understand philosophical thought experiments by concentrating on their resemblance to scientific relatives. Sorensen assesses the hazards of thought experiments and grants that there are interesting ways in which the method leads us astray, but attacks most scepticism about thought experiments as arbitrary. He maintains that they should be used--as they generally are--as part of a diversified portfolio of techniques, creating a network of cross-checks that make for impressive reliability.},

  abstract = {Ecologists routinely use statistical models to detect and explain interactions among ecological drivers, with a goal to evaluate whether an effect of interest changes in sign or magnitude in different contexts. Two fundamental properties of interactions are often overlooked during the process of hypothesising, visualising and interpreting interactions between drivers: the measurement scale -- whether a response is analysed on an additive or multiplicative scale, such as a ratio or logarithmic scale; and the symmetry -- whether dependencies are considered in both directions. Overlooking these properties can lead to one or more of three inferential errors: misinterpretation of (i) the detection and magnitude (Type-D error), and (ii) the sign of effect modification (Type-S error); and (iii) misidentification of the underlying processes (Type-A error). We illustrate each of these errors with a broad range of ecological questions applied to empirical and simulated data sets. We demonstrate how meta-analysis, a widely used approach that seeks explicitly to characterise context dependence, is especially prone to all three errors. Based on these insights, we propose guidelines to improve hypothesis generation, testing, visualisation and interpretation of interactions in ecology.},

Here we used the IAEA DLW database on energy expenditure of adults in the USA and Europe (n = 4799) to explore patterns in total (TEE: n=4799), basal (BEE: n = 1432) and physical activity energy expenditure (AEE: n = 1432) over time. In both sexes total energy expenditure (TEE) adjusted for body composition and age declined with time, while adjusted AEE increased over time. In males adjusted BEE decreased significantly, but in females this didn't reach significance. A larger dataset of basal metabolic rate (BMR equivalent to BEE) measurements of 9912 adults across 163 studies spanning 100 years replicated the decline in BEE in both sexes. Increasing obesity in the USA/Europe has probably not been fueled by reduced physical activity leading to lowered TEE. We identify here decline in adjusted BEE, as a previously unrecognized novel factor.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Isotonic exercise is the most common mode of strength training. Isotonic strength is often measured in the movement that was exercised, but isometric and isokinetic movements are also commonly used to quantify changes in muscular strength. Previous research suggests that increasing strength in one movement may not lead to an increase in strength in a different movement. Quantifying the increase in strength in a movement not trained may be important for understanding strength training adaptations and making recommendations for resistance exercise and rehabilitation programs. OBJECTIVE: To quantify changes in non-specific strength relative to a control. DESIGN: A systematic review and random effects meta-analysis was conducted investigating the effects of isotonic strength training on isotonic and isokinetic/isometric strength. SEARCH AND INCLUSION: This systematic review was conducted in Google scholar, PubMed, Academic Search Premier, and MENDELEY. To be included in this review paper the article needed to meet the following criteria: (1) report sufficient data for our variables of interest (i.e., changes in isotonic strength and changes in isokinetic or isometric strength); (2) include a time-matched non-exercise control; (3) be written in English; (4) include healthy human participants over the age of 18~years; (5) the participants had to train and test isotonically; (6) the participants had to be tested isokinetically or isometrically on a device different from that they trained on; (7) the non-specific strength task had to test a muscle involved in the training (i.e., could not have trained chest press and test handgrip strength); and (8) the control group and the experimental group had to perform the same number of strength tests. RESULTS: We completed two separate searches. In the original search a total of 880 papers were screened and nine papers met the inclusion criteria. In the secondary search a total of 2594 papers were screened and three additional papers were added (total of 12 studies). The overall effect of resistance training on changes in strength within a movement that was not directly trained was 0.8 (Cohen's d) with a standard error of 0.286. This overall effect was significant (t\,=\,2.821, p\,=\,0.01) and the 95\% confidence interval (CI) is 0.22-1.4. The overall effect of resistance training on strength changes within a movement that was directly trained was 1.84 (Cohen's d) with a standard error of 0.296. This overall effect was significant (t\,=\,6.221, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and the 95\% CI is 1.23-2.4. CONCLUSION: The results of our meta-analysis suggest that strength increases in both the specific and non-specific strength tests. However, the smaller effect size associated with non-specific strength suggests that it will be difficult for a single study to meaningfully investigate the transfer of strength training adaptions.},

To detect the onset and changes in abilities, healthcare professionals administer standardized assessments. Recently, technology has been utilized to complement these clinical assessments to gain a more objective and detailed view of functionality. In the clinic and at home, technology is able to provide more information about patient performance and reduce subjectivity in outcome measures. The timed up and go (TUG) test is one such assessment recently instrumented with technology in several studies, yielding promising results toward the future of automating clinical assessments. Potential benefits of technological TUG implementations include additional performance parameters, generated reports, and the ability to be self-administered in the home. In this paper, we provide an overview of the TUG test and technologies utilized for TUG instrumentation. We then critically review the technological advancements and follow up with an evaluation of the benefits and limitations of each approach. Finally, we analyze the gaps in the implementations and discuss challenges for future research toward automated self-administered assessment in the home.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Obesity (as defined by body mass index) has not been associated consistently with higher mortality in older adults. However, total body mass includes fat and muscle, which have different metabolic effects. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that greater muscle mass in older adults is associated with lower all-cause mortality. METHODS: All-cause mortality was analyzed by the year 2004 in 3659 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III who were aged 55 years or more (65 years if women) at the time of the survey (1988-1994). Individuals who were underweight or died in the first 2 years of follow-up were excluded to remove frail elders from the sample. Skeletal muscle mass was measured using bioelectrical impedance, and muscle mass index was defined as muscle mass divided by height squared. Modified Poisson regression and proportional hazards regression were used to examine the relationship of muscle mass index with all-cause mortality risk and rate, respectively, adjusted for central obesity (waist hip ratio) and other significant covariates. RESULTS: In adjusted analyses, total mortality was significantly lower in the fourth quartile of muscle mass index compared with the first quartile: adjusted risk ratio 0.81 (95\% confidence interval, 0.71-0.91) and adjusted hazard ratio 0.80 (95\% confidence interval, 0.66-0.97). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the survival predication ability of relative muscle mass and highlights the need to look beyond total body mass in assessing the health of older adults.},

The results indicated that 1-RM increased 40.1 \textpm{} 21.3\% and 44.5 \textpm{} 20.1\% (p {$<$} 0.01) after S and L, respectively. Muscle thickness at 50\% length was increased 10.7 \textpm{} 15.3\% (p {$<$} 0.05) and 13.7 \textpm{} 9.0\% (p {$<$} 0.01) after S and L, while at 60\% it was increased 15.5 \textpm{} 18.8\% (p {$<$} 0.05) and 19.4 \textpm{} 16.3\% (p {$<$} 0.01), respectively. Longitudinal muscle area increased similarly after S and L (p {$<$} 0.01). Fascicle angle and length were not altered with training.

  abstract = {Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is an endocrine condition associated with reproductive and psychiatric disorders, and with obesity. Eating disorders, such as bulimia and recurrent dieting, are also linked to PCOS. They can lead to the epigenetic dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis, thereby impacting on ovarian folliculogenesis. We postulate that PCOS is induced by psychological distress and episodes of overeating and/or dieting during puberty and adolescence, when body dissatisfaction and emotional distress are often present. We propose that upregulated activation of the central HPG axis during this period can be epigenetically altered by psychological stressors and by bulimia/recurrent dieting, which are common during adolescence and which can lead to PCOS. This hypothesis is based on events that occur during a largely neglected stage of female reproductive development. To date, most research into the origins of PCOS has focused on the prenatal induction of this disorder, particularly in utero androgenization and the role of anti-M\"ullerian hormone. Establishing causality in our peripubertal model requires prospective cohort studies from infancy. Mechanistic studies should consider the role of the gut microbiota in addition to the epigenetic regulation of (neuro) hormones. Finally, clinicians should consider the importance of underlying chronic psychological distress and eating disorders in PCOS.},

This study examined the ability of trainees with different experience levels to predict number of repetitions to MF. One hundred and forty-one participants underwent a full body RT session involving single sets to MF and were asked to predict the number of repetitions they could complete before reaching MF on each exercise. Participants underpredicted the number of repetitions they could perform to MF (Standard error of measurements [95\% confidence intervals] for combined sample ranged between 2.64 [2.36-2.99] and 3.38 [3.02-3.83]). There was a tendency towards improved accuracy with greater experience. Ability to predict repetitions to MF is not perfectly accurate among most trainees though may improve with experience. Thus, RIR should be used cautiously in prescription of RT. Trainers and trainees should be aware of this as it may have implications for the attainment of training goals, particularly muscular hypertrophy.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Low back pain (LBP) is highly prevalent and presents an enormous cost both through direct health care and indirectly through significant work and production loss. Low back pain is acknowledged widely to be a multifactorial pathology with a variety of symptoms, dysfunctions, and a number of possible sources of pain. One source that has been suspected and evidenced for some time is the intervertebral disc. Some degree of disc degeneration is a physiologic process associated with aging, however, more severe degeneration and/or structural abnormality may be indicative of a pathologic process or injury and is more commonly present in those suffering from LBP. Much like other tissues (ie, muscle, bone, etc.), it has been suspected that there exists an optimal loading strategy to promote the health of the disc. Exercise is often prescribed for LBP and effectively reduces pain and disability. However, whether specific loading through exercise might plausibly heal or regenerate the intervertebral discs is unknown. PURPOSE: To examine the effects of loading on regenerative processes in the intervertebral disc and consider the potential for specific exercise to apply loading to the lumbar spine to produce these effects. STUDY DESIGN: A brief narrative literature review. METHODS: Studies examining the effects of loading on the intervertebral discs were reviewed to examine the plausibility of using loading through exercise to induce regeneration or healing of the intervertebral disc. RESULTS: Research from animal model studies suggests the existence of a dose-response relationship between loading and regenerative processes. Although high loading at high volumes and frequencies might accelerate degeneration or produce disc injury, high loading, yet of low volume and at low frequency appears to induce potentially regenerative mechanisms, including improvements in disc proteoglycan content, matrix gene expression, rate of cell apoptosis, and improved fluid flow and solute transport. CONCLUSIONS: Research suggests a dose-response relationship between loading and disc regenerative processes and that the loading pattern typically used in the lumbar extension resistance exercise interventions (high load, low volume, and low frequency) might impart healing or regeneration of the intervertebral discs. Future research should examine an exercise intervention with in~vivo measurement of changes in disc condition. This may provide further evidence for the "black box" of treatment mechanisms associated with exercise interventions.},

  abstract = {'Effort' is a concept of interest in cognitive psychology and neuroscience where many theories include it as a postulate. Despite its intuitiveness it is difficult to define such that its operationalisation follows a logical derivation chain. Recently I have proposed conceptual definitions of both actual effort, and the perception of effort, as the ratio of task demands to capacity to meet task demands, both actual and perceived respectively. Clear conceptual definitions are key for determining whether a given operationalisation meets the necessary and sufficient conditions adequately. For physical tasks valid operationalisation, and indeed measurement, of actual effort is often trivial. But a problem arises for operationalisation of actual effort in cognitive tasks where the underlying capacity that disposes an individual to be able to attempt, and perhaps complete, the task is not directly observable nor is the demand the task presents. However, a solution may lie in applications of Additive Conjoint Measurement to determine conditions where classical measurement may be possible, and the Rasch model as a measurement operation of capacity and demands to derive effort. A key aspect of the Rasch model is that it posits and estimates from data two latent constructs that I accept here as conceptually equivalent to capacity and demands respectively in my definition of effort; first a characteristic of the individual (ability), and second a characteristic of the test or item (difficulty). As such, applications of these methods might provide a measurement operation of actual effort in cognitive tasks to enable more precise formulations and testing of theories that employ the concept. In this work I explore these ideas using simulation and analogical abduction of a task where effort is known and examine an empirical dataset. Finally, I discuss the conditions under which these methods may be suitable and their inherent limitations.},

  abstract = {Prolonged periods in microgravity ({$\mu$}G) environments result in deconditioning of numerous physiological systems, particularly muscle at molecular, single fiber, and whole muscle levels. This deconditioning leads to loss of strength and cardiorespiratory fitness. Loading muscle produces mechanical tension with resultant mechanotransduction initiating molecular signaling that stimulates adaptations in muscle. Exercise can reverse deconditioning resultant from phases of detraining, de-loading, or immobilization. On Earth, applications of loading using exercise models are common, as well as in {$\mu$}G settings as countermeasures to deconditioning. The primary modalities include, but are not limited to, aerobic training (or "cardio") and resistance training, and have historically been dichotomized; the former primarily thought to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, and the latter primarily improving strength and muscle size. However, recent work questions this dichotomy, suggesting adaptations to loading through exercise are affected by intensity of effort independent of modality. Furthermore, similar adaptations may occur where sufficient intensity of effort is used. Traditional countermeasures for {$\mu$}G-induced deconditioning have focused upon engineering-based solutions to enable application of traditional models of exercise. Yet, contemporary developments in understanding of the applications, and subsequent adaptations, to exercise induced muscular loading in terrestrial settings have advanced such in recent years that it may be appropriate to revisit the evidence to inform how exercise can used in {$\mu$}G. With the planned decommissioning of the International Space Station as early as 2024 and future goals of manned moon and Mars missions, efficiency of resources must be prioritized. Engineering-based solutions to apply exercise modalities inevitably present issues relating to devices mass, size, energy use, heat production, and ultimately cost. It is necessary to identify exercise countermeasures to combat deconditioning while limiting these issues. As such, this brief narrative review considers recent developments in our understanding of skeletal muscle adaptation to loading through exercise from studies conducted in terrestrial settings, and their applications in {$\mu$}G environments. We consider the role of intensity of effort, comparisons of exercise modalities, the need for concurrent exercise approaches, and other issues often not considered in terrestrial exercise studies but are of concern in {$\mu$}G environments (i.e., O2 consumption, CO2 production, and energy costs of exercise).},

However, specialised stadiometers for this are often custom-built and expensive. Generic wall-mounted stadiometers alternatively are common in clinics and laboratories. This study examined the reliability of a custom set-up utilising a wall-mounted stadiometer for measurement of spinal height using custom built wall mounted postural rods. Twelve participants with non-specific chronic low back pain (CLBP; females n = 5, males n = 7) underwent measurement of spinal height on three separate consecutive days at the same time of day where 10 measurements were taken at 20 s intervals. Comparisons were made using repeated measures analysis of variance for 'trial' and 'gender'. There were no significant effects by trial or interaction effects of trial x gender. Intra-individual absolute standard error of measurement (SEM) was calculated for spinal height using the first of the 10 measures, the average of 10 measures, the total shrinkage, and the rate of shrinkage across the 10 measures examined as the slope of the curve when a linear regression was fitted. SEMs were 3.1 mm, 2.8 mm, 2.6 mm and 0.212, respectively. Absence of significant differences between trials and the reported SEMs suggests this custom set-up for measuring spinal height changes is suitable use as an outcome measure in either research or clinical practice in participants with CLBP.},

The aim of this study was to examine reliability of trainee ratings of perceived effort (RPE-E) and discomfort (RPE-D) using two novel scales in addition to reliability and validity of trainer RPE-E. Design: Participants underwent 3 RT trials over a period of three weeks. Methods: Seventeen participants (males n = 6, females n = 11, age 63 \textpm{} 16 years) completed 5 RT exercises for a single set using a load permitting a self-determined 6 repetition maximum (meaning they determined inability to complete further repetitions if attempted i.e. they predicted momentary failure on the next repetition). Trainers completed their rating of RPE-E, followed by participants reporting of RPE-E and RPE-D immediately after completion of the exercises. Spearman's correlations examined the relationship between RPE-E and RPE-D. Reliability was examined as standard error of measurement (SEM) calculated for each outcome across the 3 trials (intra-rater), in addition to agreement between trainers (inter-rater), and agreement between trainer and trainee RPE-E. Results: Correlations between RPE-E and RPE-D were significant but weak (r = .373 to 0.492; p {$<$} 0.01). Intra-rater SEMs for trainee RPE-E ranged from 0.64 to 0.85, trainee RPE-D ranged from 0.60 to 1.00, and trainer RPE-E ranged from 0.56 to 0.71. Inter-rater SEMs for trainer RPE-E ranged 0.25 to 0.66. SEMs for agreement between trainer and trainee RPE-E ranged from 1.03 to 1.25. Conclusions: Results suggest participants were able to differentiate RPE-E and RPE-D and that the reliability for both trainee measures of RPE-E and RPE-D, in addition to trainer RPE-E is acceptable. Further, trainer RPE-E appeared to have acceptable validity compared to trainee RPE-E.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Studies reporting isolated lumbar extension strength changes were examined for inclusion criteria including: (1) participants with chronic low back pain, (2) intervention\,{$\geq$}\,four\,weeks including isolated lumbar extension exercise, (3) outcome measures including isolated lumbar extension strength, pain (Visual Analogue Scale), and disability (Oswestry Disability Index). Six studies encompassing 281 participants were included. Correlations among change in isolated lumbar extension strength, pain, and disability. Participants were grouped as "met" or "not met" based on minimal clinically important changes and between groups comparisons conducted. RESULTS: Isolated lumbar extension strength and Visual Analogue Scale pooled analysis showed significant weak to moderate correlations (r\,=\,-0.391 to -0.539, all p\,{$<$}\,0.001). Isolated lumbar extension strength and Oswestry Disability Index pooled analysis showed significant weak correlations (r\,=\,-0.349 to -0.470, all p\,{$<$}\,0.001). For pain and disability, isolated lumbar extension strength changes were greater for those "met" compared with those "not met" (p\,{$<$}\,0.001-0.008). CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in isolated lumbar extension strength may be related to positive and meaningful clinical outcomes. As many other performance outcomes and clinical outcomes are not related, isolated lumbar extension strength change may be a mechanism of action affecting symptom improvement. Implications for Rehabilitation Chronic low back pain is often associated with deconditioning of the lumbar extensor musculature. Isolated lumbar extension exercise has been shown to condition this musculature and also reduce pain and disability. This study shows significant correlations between increases in isolated lumbar extension strength and reductions in pain and disability. Strengthening of the lumbar extensor musculature could be considered an important target for exercise interventions.},

  abstract = {Objectives: Researchers and practitioners in sports science aim to generate, and apply, knowledge to improve sports perfor mance. One area of interest is the role that muscular strength, and thus approaches to improve this (i.e. resistance training), has upon sports performance. In this review we briefly consider the evidence regarding an answer to the causal question ``Does increasing an athletes' strength improve sports performance?''. Design \& Methods: We first consider the Applied Research Model for the Sport Sciences (ARMSS) to frame the problem and answer this. We then highlight barriers to answering it (and other causal questions) before offering suggestions to address these. Results: Muscular strength typically differentiates elite and non-elite athletes, and is correlated with proxy measures of sports performance. However, there is insufficient evidence to make a definitive statement regarding the causal effect of muscular strength upon sports performance. Conclusions: Considering the ARMSS, evidence is lacking whether improving muscular strength is causally related to sports performance. Present evidence is primarily observational and cross-sectional, experimental evidence is limited and focused upon proxy measures of sports performance, primarily conducted in small samples, and with little consideration regarding meaningfulness of effects. Suggestions to help improve research in this area and better answer this question include: larger sample sizes, determination of smallest effect sizes of interest for outcomes including muscular strength and proxy measures of sports performance (using both anchoring and/or expert opinion), and use of causal inference methods for observational data (actual sports performance, performance indicators, and fitness measures) including graphical causal diagrams and mediation analysis.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: The present study examined the progressive implementation of a high effort resistance training (RT) approach in older adults over 6 months and through a 6-month follow-up on strength, body composition, function, and wellbeing of older adults. METHODS: Twenty-three older adults (aged 61 to 80 years) completed a 6-month supervised RT intervention applying progressive introduction of higher effort set end points. After completion of the intervention participants could choose to continue performing RT unsupervised until 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Strength, body composition, function, and wellbeing all significantly improved over the intervention. Over the follow-up, body composition changes reverted to baseline values, strength was reduced though it remained significantly higher than baseline, and wellbeing outcomes were mostly maintained. Comparisons over the follow-up between those who did and those who did not continue with RT revealed no significant differences for changes in any outcome measure. CONCLUSIONS: Supervised RT employing progressive application of high effort set end points is well tolerated and effective in improving strength, body composition, function, and wellbeing in older adults. However, whether participants continued, or did not, with RT unsupervised at follow-up had no effect on outcomes perhaps due to reduced effort employed during unsupervised RT.},

  abstract = {Background/Aim. Exercise designed to condition the lumbar extensor musculature is often included in resistance training (RT) programs. It is suggested that deconditioning of this musculature may be linked to low back pain. Thus effective means of conditioning these muscles are of interest to pursue. Evidence suggests that isolated lumbar extension (ILEX) RT might be most efficacious, however, the best means of manipulating resistance training variables in this regard is unknown. Set volume is an easily manipulated RT variable and one thought to also interact with training status. As such this study sought to examine the effect of set volume during ILEX RT in trained males. Methods. Trained males previously engaged in exercises designed to condition the lumbar extensors underwent a 6 week intervention and were randomised to either a single set (1ST, n = 9), multiple set (3ST, n = 8) or control group (CON, n = 9). Pre- and post-testing of ILEX strength was conducted. Results. Both 1ST and 3ST significantly increased ILEX strength (p {$<$} 0.05) with large effect sizes (d = 0.89 and 0.95 respectively) whereas the CON group produced significant losses (-8.9\%) with a moderate effect size (d = - 0.53). There was no statistically significant difference in ILEX strength gains when 1ST and 3ST were directly compared (p = 0.336). Conclusions. The results of this study suggest that significant ILEX strength changes occur in trained males as a result of 6 weeks of ILEX RT and that these changes are unaffected by set volume.},

  abstract = {It is well known that physical activity and exercise is associated with a lower risk of a range of morbidities and all-cause mortality. Further, it appears that risk reductions are greater when physical activity and/or exercise is performed at a higher intensity of effort. Why this may be the case is perhaps explained by the accumulating evidence linking physical fitness and performance outcomes (e.g. cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, and muscle mass) also to morbidity and mortality risk. Current guidelines about the performance of moderate/vigorous physical activity using aerobic exercise modes focuses upon the accumulation of a minimum volume of physical activity and/or exercise, and have thus far produced disappointing outcomes. As such there has been increased interest in the use of higher effort physical activity and exercise as being potentially more efficacious. Though there is currently debate as to the effectiveness of public health prescription based around higher effort physical activity and exercise, most discussion around this has focused upon modes considered to be traditionally 'aerobic' (e.g. running, cycling, rowing, swimming etc.). A mode customarily performed to a relatively high intensity of effort that we believe has been overlooked is resistance training. Current guidelines do include recommendations to engage in 'muscle strengthening activities' though there has been very little emphasis upon these modes in either research or public health effort. As such the purpose of this debate article is to discuss the emerging higher effort paradigm in physical activity and exercise for public health and to make a case for why there should be a greater emphasis placed upon resistance training as a mode in this paradigm shift.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Understanding the impact of lockdown upon resistance training (RT), and how people adapted their RT behaviours, has implications for strategies to maintain engagement in similar positive health behaviours. Further, doing so will provide a baseline for investigation of the long-term effects of these public health measures upon behaviours and perceptions, and facilitate future follow-up study. OBJECTIVES: To determine how the onset of coronavirus (COVID-19), and associated 'lockdown', affected RT behaviours, in addition to motivation, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and intent to continue, in those who regularly performed RT prior to the pandemic. METHODS: We conducted an observational, cross-sectional study using online surveys in multiple languages (English, Danish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Slovakian, Swedish, and Japanese) distributed across social media platforms and through authors' professional and personal networks. Adults (n\,=\,5389; median age\,=\,31~years [interquartile range (IQR)\,=\,25, 38]), previously engaged in RT prior to lockdown (median prior RT experience\,=\,7~years [IQR\,=\,4, 12]) participated. Outcomes were self-reported RT behaviours including: continuation of RT during lockdown, location of RT, purchase of specific equipment for RT, method of training, full-body or split routine, types of training, repetition ranges, exercise number, set volumes (per exercise and muscle group), weekly frequency of training, perception of effort, whether training was planned/recorded, time of day, and training goals. Secondary outcomes included motivation, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and intent to continue RT. RESULTS: A majority of individuals (82.8\%) maintained participation in RT during-lockdown. Marginal probabilities from generalised linear models and generalised estimating equations for RT behaviours were largely similar from pre- to during-lockdown. There was reduced probability of training in privately owned gyms (\textasciitilde\,59\% to\,\textasciitilde\,7\%) and increased probability of training at home (\textasciitilde\,18\% to\,\textasciitilde\,89\%); greater probability of training using a full-body routine (\textasciitilde\,38\% to\,\textasciitilde\,51\%); reduced probability of resistance machines (\textasciitilde\,66\% to\,\textasciitilde\,13\%) and free weight use (\textasciitilde\,96\% to\,\textasciitilde\,81\%), and increased probability of bodyweight training (\textasciitilde\,62\% to\,\textasciitilde\,82\%); reduced probability of moderate repetition ranges (\textasciitilde\,62-82\% to\,\textasciitilde\,55-66\%) and greater probability of higher repetition ranges (\textasciitilde\,27\% to\,\textasciitilde\,49\%); and moderate reduction in the perception of effort experienced during-training (r\,=\,0.31). Further, individuals were slightly less likely to plan or record training during lockdown and many changed their training goals. Additionally, perceived effectiveness, enjoyment, and likelihood of continuing current training were all lower during-lockdown. CONCLUSIONS: Those engaged in RT prior to lockdown these behaviours with only slight adaptations in both location and types of training performed. However, people employed less effort, had lower motivation, and perceived training as less effective and enjoyable, reporting their likelihood of continuing current training was similar or lower than pre-lockdown. These results have implications for strategies to maintain engagement in positive health behaviours such as RT during-restrictive pandemic-related public health measures.

  abstract = {Objective. Loss of disc height is commonly associated with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Isolated lumbar extension (ILEX) exercise for the lumbar extensors is recommended to treat CLBP and is suggested such exercise might promote disc healing and regeneration. This study examined a 12-week ILEX intervention on indirect determination of disc height and shrinkage through seated stadiometry, strength, pain, and disability. Design. A quasi-experimental wait-list controlled design was used. Nine participants underwent pretesting (T1), a 12-week control period, retesting (T2), a 12-week intervention period, and finally posttesting (T3). Seated stadiometry, ILEX strength, pain, and disability were measured at each time point. Results. No significant repeated-measures effects for any seated stadiometry variables occurred. Significant improvement across the intervention period (T2 to T3) was found for strength (P {$<$}0.0001; effect size [ES] = 2.42). Change in pain was not significant for repeated effects (P = 0.064); however, ES for the intervention period (T2 to T3) was moderate (ES = -0.77). Change in disability was significant between time point T1 and T3 (P = 0.037) and ES for the intervention period (T2 to T3) was large (ES = -0.92). Pain and disability achieved minimal clinically important changes. Conclusions. This is apparently the first study to examine disc change in vivo after exercise in CLBP. Results of the present study, though supporting ILEX resistance training to improve strength, pain, and disability, did not find any effect on spinal height.},

Results: All models demonstrated a robust linear-log relationship with the first derivatives (i.e., changes in strength with time) trending asymptotically such that by \textasciitilde 1-2~years strength had practically reached a "plateau." Sex, bodyweight, and age had minimal interaction effects. However, substantial strength gains were apparent; approximately \textasciitilde 30-50\% gains over the first year reaching \textasciitilde 50-60\% of baseline 6~years later. Conclusion: It is unclear if the "plateau" can be overcome through alternative approaches, or whether over the long-term strength gains differ. Considering this, our results support public health recommendations for minimal-dose resistance training for strength adaptations in adults.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic low back pain is a multifactorial condition with many dysfunctions including gait variability. The lumbar spine and its musculature are involved during gait and in chronic low back pain the lumbar extensors are often deconditioned. It was therefore of interest to examine relationships between lumbar kinematic variability during gait, with pain, disability and isolated lumbar extension strength in participants with chronic low back pain. METHODS: Twenty four participants with chronic low back pain were assessed for lumbar kinematics during gait, isolated lumbar extension strength, pain, and disability. Angular displacement and kinematic waveform pattern and offset variability were examined. FINDINGS: Angular displacement and kinematic waveform pattern and offset variability differed across movement planes; displacement was highest and similar in frontal and transverse planes, and pattern variability and offset variability higher in the sagittal plane compared to frontal and transverse planes which were similar. Spearman's correlations showed significant correlations between transverse plane pattern variability and isolated lumbar extension strength (r=-.411) and disability (r=.401). However, pain was not correlated with pattern variability in any plane. The r(2) values suggested 80.5\% to 86.3\% of variance was accounted for by other variables. INTERPRETATION: Considering the lumbar extensors role in gait, the relationship between both isolated lumbar extension strength and disability with transverse plane pattern variability suggests that gait variability may result in consequence of lumbar extensor deconditioning or disability accompanying chronic low back pain. However, further study should examine the temporality of these relationships and other variables might account for the unexplained variance.},

This database would be used to facilitate continued evaluation of ERS. The use of health databases can spur scientific investigation and the generation of evidence regarding healthcare practice. NICE's recommendation has not yet been met by public health bodies. Through collaboration between ukactive, ReferAll, a specialist in software solutions for exercise referral, and the National Centre for Sport and Exercise Medicine, which has its research hub at the Advanced Wellbeing Research Centre, in Sheffield, data has been collated from multiple UK-based ERS to generate one of the largest databases of its kind. This database moves the research community towards meeting NICEs recommendation. This paper describes the formation and open sharing of The National ReferAll Database, data-cleaning processes, and its structure, including outcome measures. Collating data from 123 ERSs on 39,283 individuals, a database has been created containing both scheme and referral level characteristics in addition to outcome measures over time. The National ReferAll Database is openly available for researchers to interrogate. The National ReferAll Database represents a potentially valuable resource for the wider research community, as well as policy makers and practitioners in this area, which will facilitate a better understanding of ERS and other physical-activity-related social prescribing pathways to help inform public health policy and practice.},

  abstract = {The actual capacity to perform tasks, and actual fatigue, are concepts that have been thought of as inherently linked. These considerations also extend to their phenomenology, meaning the *perception(s) of* capacity or fatigue. The phenomenology of capacity or fatigue thus may be capturing the same underlying latent construct. Further, it is speculated that the actual capacity of a person to perform a given task, and their perception of that capacity, have a psychophysical relationship. The aim of this study was therefore twofold: 1) to explore the extensional equivalence of perceptions of capacity and fatigue, and 2) to explore the relationship between actual capacity and the perception of that capacity. We analysed secondary outcomes from two experiments where 21 participants performed various elbow flexion tasks with either a dumbell, or a connected adaptive resistance exercise (CARE) machine enabling measurement of actual capacity (i.e., maximal force). Mixed effects ordered beta regression models estimated the latent constructs during conditions from self-reports of perceptions of capacity and fatigue comparing the two operationalisations, and the relationship between actual capacity (i.e., \% maximal force) and self-reports of perceptions of capacity. We hypothesised that, given their theoretical extensional equivalence, the latent constructs captured by self-report ratings as operationalisations of perceptions of capacity and fatigue would exhibit a strong negative relationship between each other reflecting strong identity, and a positive association albeit with weak as opposed to strong identity between actual capacity and perception of capacity. Our results appear to broadly corroborate both hypotheses. There was a very strong relationship indicating strong identity and thus extensional equivalence of perceptions of capacity and fatigue latent constructs (r = -0.989 [95\% CI -0.994 to -0.981]). Further, a coarse grained directional relationship between actual capacity and the perception of capacity was present suggesting only weak identity at best. Future research should endeavour to identify conditions permitting testing of assumptions of the present work (i.e., the quantity assumption) and explore further possible psychophysical models relating actual, and perceptions of, demands, capacity, and effort to understand the impact of the former upon the latter given the conceptual relationships between them.},

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effects of full range of motion (ROM) and limited ROM isolated lumbar extension exercise upon full ROM lumbar extension strength, ROM, perceived pain, and disability. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Limited ROM is common in chronic low back pain as is lumbar extensor deconditioning. Limited ROM exercise is a common prescription but is yet to be empirically tested. METHODS: Males (n = 21) and females (n = 17) with nonspecific chronic low back pain were initially recruited. Participants were randomized to either a full ROM (FullROM) or limited ROM (LimROM) training group or a control group. A total of 24 participants (males: n = 14, females: n = 10) completed the study and were included in analysis. The intervention lasted 12 weeks. FullROM and LimROM groups completed isolated lumbar extension resistance training once per week, performing one set of exercise at 80\% of their maximal tested functional torque to failure. FullROM group trained through a full ROM. LimROM group trained through the mid 50\% of their full ROM.Full ROM isolated lumbar extension strength, lumbar and standing ROM (Schobers test), perceived pain (visual analogue scale), and disability (Revised Oswestry Disability Index) were measured pre- and postintervention. RESULTS: FullROM and LimROM significantly improved in full ROM lumbar extension strength, perceived pain, and disability compared with the control group. No changes occurred in lumbar or standing ROM. No significant differences were found between either FullROM or LimROM for any outcome measure. Changes in perceived pain and disability met minimal clinically important change values for FullROM (visual analogue scale, -30.3 + 25.76 mm and Oswestry Disability Index, -18.2 + 6.63 patients) and LimROM (visual analogue scale, -16.29 + 10.97 mm and Oswestry Disability Index, -12 + 5.16 patients). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that both FullROM and LimROM are equally effective in increasing full ROM lumbar extension strength and producing clinically meaningful improvement in perceived pain and disability.},

OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of isolated lumbar extension resistance training on lumbar kinematic variability during gait in participants with CLBP. DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: University Health, Exercise and Sport Science Laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four participants with nonspecific CLBP. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly allocated to a 12-week isolated lumbar extension exercise intervention (1\texttimes/week performing a single set to momentary muscular failure using a load equal to 80\% max tested torque) or nontraining control period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Lumbar kinematics during gait, including angular displacement, kinematic waveform pattern (CVp), and offset (CVo) variability, were examined via 3-dimensional analyses. RESULTS: No significant changes in displacement or CVo were found as a result of the intervention; however, a small but significant reduction in sagittal plane CVp (-20.90 \textpm{} 3.53\%, effect size = 0.48, P = .044) occurred, indicating improved motor pattern replication through this movement plane. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the role of the lumbar extensors in gait, and their common deconditioning in CLBP, an isolated lumbar extension resistance exercise intervention may reduce gait variability. These results suggest isolated lumbar extension exercise may specifically reduce sagittal plane variability, indicating improved motor pattern replication through this movement plane, perhaps attributable to the plane of movement used during the exercise.},

Discussions of 'disuse' refer to general physical inactivity, which evidence suggests does not differ between symptomatic and asymptomatic persons. 'Deconditioning' refers to a decrease in function, commonly both cardiovascular/aerobic fitness and muscular strength/endurance, again noting little difference. However, examination of decreased function relating specifically to lumbar extensor musculature deconditioning has yet to be examined, corroborating all possible methods. Thus, this review attempts to reappraise the deconditioning hypothesis in LBP, specifically considering lumbar extensor deconditioning. METHODS: A literature review was conducted examining both cross-sectional and prospective data on specific lumbar extensor deconditioning and LBP. A narrative approach and 'snowballing' style literature search was used involving initial use of PubMed and Google Scholar databases searching up to December 2012. Included were studies utilizing the following three research methods, allowing specific induction of the role of such deconditioning; (1) strength/endurance testing of the isolated lumbar extensor musculature, (2) imaging and histochemical examination of the lumbar extensor musculature, and (3) fatigue testing of the lumbar extensor musculature using electromyography. RESULTS/FINDINGS: Despite issues interpreting individual studies due to methods, the majority of evidence suggests LBP is associated with decreased strength/endurance, atrophy, and excessive fatigability of the lumbar extensors. Prospective studies also suggest lumbar extensor deconditioning may be a common risk factor predicting acute low back injury and LBP. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis of specific lumbar extensor deconditioning as being a causal factor in LBP is presently well supported. It is by no means the only causative factor and further research should more rigorously test this hypothesis addressing the methodological issues highlighted regarding previous studies. However, its role suggests specific exercise may be a worthwhile preventative and rehabilitative approach.},

To date no review article has considered the underlying physiological mechanisms that might support such improvements. This article is a comprehensive, systematic narrative review of the literature surrounding the area of resistance training, cardiovascular fitness and the acute responses and chronic adaptations it produces. The primary concern with existing research is the lack of clarity and inappropriate quantification of resistance training intensity. Thus, an important consideration of this review is the effect of intensity. The acute metabolic and molecular responses to resistance training to momentary muscular failure do not differ from that of traditional endurance training. Myocardial function appears to be maintained, perhaps enhanced, in acute response to high intensity resistance training, and contraction intensity appears to mediate the acute vascular response to resistance training. The results of chronic physiological adaptations demonstrate that resistance training to momentary muscular failure produces a number of physiological adaptations, which may facilitate the observed improvements in cardiovascular fitness. The adaptations may include an increase in mitochondrial enzymes, mitochondrial proliferation, phenotypic conversion from type IIx towards type IIa muscle fibers, and vascular remodeling (including capillarization). Resistance training to momentary muscular failure causes sufficient acute stimuli to produce chronic physiological adaptations that enhance cardiovascular fitness. This review appears to be the first to present this conclusion and, therefore, it may help stimulate a changing paradigm addressing the misnomer of 'cardiovascular' exercise as being determined by modality.},

Many resistance exercises for the lumbar extensors exist, although recent evidence suggests that isolated lumbar extension (ILEX) resistance training may best for conditioning these muscles. Thus this review aimed to examine the use of ILEX resistance training in participants with CLBP to provide a best-evidence synthesis for practitioners and clinicians. LITERATURE SURVEY: Reference lists from previous reviews were searched in addition to SPORTDiscus, PubMed, and Google Scholar databases up to May 2014 using search terms including combinations and synonyms of "isolation," "lumbar extension," "lumbar exercise," "lumbar strength," "lumbar endurance," "lumbar spine," "low back exercise," "CLBP," "pain," and "disability." METHODOLOGY: A "snowballing"-style literature search was used that involved an emergent approach. Studies examining ILEX resistance training as an intervention in symptomatic CLBP populations reporting pain, disability, or global perceived outcomes (GPO) as outcomes were examined. Pain and disability were outcomes and were compared to consensus guidelines for minimal clinically important changes. Single case reports were excluded. SYNTHESIS: Results suggest that ILEX resistance training produces significant and meaningful improvements in perceived pain, disability, and GPOs, as part of a multiple intervention or stand-alone approach. A low frequency (once per week) yet high intensity of effort (to momentary muscular failure) approach using either full or limited range-of-motion ILEX resistance training appears to be sufficient and best for significant and meaningful outcomes. Limited comparative studies between ILEX resistance training and other specific exercise approaches exist; however, only limited evidence supports ILEX resistance training as being more effective. CONCLUSIONS: These findings highlight ILEX resistance training as effective for significant and meaningful improvements in perceived pain, disability, and GPOs for CLBP participants. Further research should elucidate comparisons between ILEX resistance training and other specific exercise approaches and should clarify whether lumbar extensor conditioning is the mechanism responsible for the improvements reported.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the specificity of exercises designed to condition the lumbar extensor musculature (ie, lumbar erector spinae and multifidus). METHODS: A review of studies examining effects of exercises designed to condition the lumbar extensors was conducted. Included were studies that examined the acute activation and chronic adaptation of the lumbar extensor musculature in response to benches and roman chair trunk extensions, free weights exercises (ie, deadlifts, squats, good-mornings, etc), floor and stability ball exercise (ie, trunk extensions, bridging, four-point kneeling, etc) and resistance machines (ie, those with and without pelvic restraints). RESULTS: Evidence suggests that the reviewed exercises designed to condition the lumbar extensors all may result in significant activation of this musculature during their performance. However, examination of training studies shows that for benches and roman chair trunk extensions, free weights exercises, floor and stability ball exercise and resistance machines without appropriate pelvic restraints, evidence suggests that they may be less effective for inducing chronic adaptations in the lumbar extensors as a result of their performance. Contrastingly, resistance machines that employ appropriate pelvic restraint to isolate lumbar extension are better evidenced to confer specific adaptations to the lumbar extensors. CONCLUSIONS: Numerous exercise approaches have been designed with the intention of conditioning the lumbar extensors. Those examined appear to activate the lumbar extensors; however, the specificity of many of these exercises for producing chronic adaptations may be questionable, potentially due to the compound nature of them allowing involvement of other musculature such as the hip extensors. Many of the reviewed exercises offer potential to condition the lumbar extensors, however, isolation of lumbar extension through appropriate pelvic restraint appears important for optimising specific adaptations in the lumbar extensors.},

Thirty-three untrained adolescents of both sexes (males, n = 17; females, n = 16; 14 \textpm{} 1 years) were randomly assigned into either (i) HL (n = 17): performing 3 sets of 4-6 repetitions to momentary concentric failure; or (ii) LL (n = 16): performing 2 sets of 12-15 repetitions to momentary concentric failure. RT was performed for 2\texttimes/week for 9 weeks. Change in maximum strength (1 repetition maximum) and absolute muscular endurance for barbell bench press was assessed. Weekly volume-load was calculated as sets (n) \texttimes{} repetitions (n) \texttimes{} load (kg). Ninety-five percent confidence intervals (CIs) revealed that both groups significantly increased in strength and absolute endurance with large effect sizes (d = 1.51-1.66). There were no between-group differences for change in strength or absolute endurance. Ninety-five percent CIs revealed that both groups significantly increased in weekly volume-load with large effect sizes (HL = 1.66, LL = 1.02). There were no between-group differences for change in volume-load though average weekly volume-load was significantly greater for LL (p {$<$} 0.001). Significant Pearson's correlations were found for the HL group between average weekly volume-load and both strength (r = 0.650, p = 0.005) and absolute endurance (r = 0.552, p = 0.022) increases. Strength and absolute endurance increases do not differ between HL and LL conditions in adolescents when performed to momentary concentric failure. Under HL conditions greater weekly volume-load is associated with greater strength and absolute endurance increases.},

Nine healthy males underwent a within session randomised crossover design where they completed both the leg press and recumbent cycle ergometer conditions. Conditions were approximately matched for effort and duration (leg press: 4~\texttimes ~12RM using a 2~s concentric and 3~s eccentric repetition duration controlled with a metronome, thus each set lasted ~60~s; recumbent cycle ergometer: 4~\texttimes ~60~s bouts using a resistance level permitting 80-100 rpm but culminating with being unable to sustain the minimum cadence for the final 5-10~s). Measurements included VO2, respiratory exchange ratio (RER), blood lactate, energy expenditure, muscle swelling, and electromyography. Perceived effort was similar between conditions and thus both were well matched with respect to effort. There were no significant effects by 'condition' in any of the physiological responses examined (all p~{$>~$}0.05). The present study shows that, when both effort and duration are matched, resistance training (leg press) and 'cardio' exercise (recumbent cycle ergometry) may produce largely similar responses in VO2, RER, blood lactate, energy expenditure, muscle swelling, and electromyography. It therefore seems reasonable to suggest that both may offer a similar stimulus to produce chronic physiological adaptations in outcomes such as cardiorespiratory fitness, strength, and hypertrophy. Future work should look to both replicate the study conducted here with respect to the same, and additional physiological measures, and rigorously test the comparative efficacy of effort and duration matched exercise of differing modalities with respect to chronic improvements in physiological fitness.},

Although reported as effective, variability in response in CLBP populations is not well investigated. This study investigated variability in responsiveness to isolated lumbar extension (ILEX) resistance training in CLBP participants by retrospective analysis of three previous randomized controlled trials. Data from 77 participants were available for the intervention arms (males = 43, females = 34) 37 participants data (males = 20, females = 17) from the control arms. Intervention participants had all undergone 12 weeks of ILEX resistance training and changes in ILEX strength, pain (visual analogue scale; VAS), and disability (Oswestry disability index; ODI) measured. True inter-individual (i.e., between participants) variability in response was examined through calculation of difference in the standard deviation of change scores for both control and intervention arms. Intervention participants were classified into responder status using k-means cluster analysis for ILEX strength changes and using minimal clinically important change cut-offs for VAS and ODI. Change in average ILEX strength ranged 7.6 Nm (1.9\%) to 192.1 Nm (335.7\%). Change in peak ILEX strength ranged -12.2 Nm (-17.5\%) to 276.6 Nm (169.6\%). Participants were classified for strength changes as low (n = 31), medium (n = 36), and high responders (n = 10). Change in VAS ranged 12.0 mm to -84.0 mm. Participants were classified for VAS changes as negative (n = 3), non-responders (n = 34), responders (n = 15), and high responders (n = 19). Change in ODI ranged 18 pts to -45 pts. Participants were classified for ODI changes as negative (n = 2), non-responders (n = 21), responders (n = 29), and high responders (n = 25). Considerable variation exists in response to ILEX resistance training in CLBP. Clinicians should be aware of this and future work should identify factors prognostic of successful outcomes.},

  abstract = {Despite its apparent intuitiveness and widespread interest across various fields, `effort' is a concept that seems difficult to define. The purpose of this article is to consider and define `effort' during attempted task performance. In doing so I argue for distinction between the actual effort (objective effort) required, and the perception of that effort (subjective effort), during intentionally attempted task performance. I adopt a set theoretical approach to defining the intensional concepts, and extensional phenomenal constructs, and employ the tradition of Theory-Theory to illustrate tentative causal theories for and relating the concepts. The definitions I propose are deliberately agnostic of the specific task demands being attempted (e.g. physical, cognitive, self-control, or a combination) and thus reflect `general' definitions of effort and its perception. Throughout, I draw upon and synthesise literature from across a multitude of disciplines, combining empirical evidence with armchair philosophising, and offer what insights I have from my own experience both as someone experiencing `effort', and as a third-person observer investigating it. This work is intended to, at the very least, make my own current pretheoretical conceptualisation and understanding of `effort' transparent to other researchers, and aid interpretation of subsequent empirical work, theory building, and theory testing on the topic. Further, I hope it might be useful to researchers across various fields, unify paradigms and help with integration of learnings across disciplines, and further understanding of the role of `effort' and its perception from a broad scientific perspective.},

Furthermore, women with PCOS often suffer from excessive anxiety and depression, elicited by low self-esteem due to obesity, acne, and hirsutism. These mood disorders are commonly associated with food cravings and binge eating. Hypothalamic signaling regulates appetite and satiety, deteriorating excessive food consumption. However, the hypothalamic function is incapable of compensating for surplus food in women with PCOS, leading to the aggravation of obesity and a vicious circle. Hyperandrogenism, IR, the reduced secretion of cholecystokinin postprandially, and leptin resistance defined by leptin receptors' knockout in the hypothalamus have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypothalamic dysfunction and appetite dysregulation. Diet modifications, exercise, and psychological and medical interventions have been applied to alleviate food disorders, interrupting the vicious circle. Cognitive-behavioral intervention seems to be the mainstay of treatment, while the role of medical agents, such as GLP-1 analogs and naltrexone/bupropion, has emerged.},

  abstract = {Rasch's unidimensional models for measurement show how to connect object measures (e.g., reader abilities), measurement mechanisms (e.g., machine-generated cloze reading items), and observational outcomes (e.g., counts correct on reading instruments). Substantive theory shows what interventions or manipulations to the measurement mechanism can be traded off against a change to the object measure to hold the observed outcome constant. A Rasch model integrated with a substantive theory dictates the form and substance of permissible interventions. Rasch analysis, absent construct theory and an associated specification equation, is a black box in which understanding may be more illusory than not. Finally, the quantitative hypothesis can be tested by comparing theory-based trade-off relations with observed trade-off relations. Only quantitative variables (as measured) support such trade-offs. Note that to test the quantitative hypothesis requires more than manipulation of the algebraic equivalencies in the Rasch model or descriptively fitting data to the model. A causal Rasch model involves experimental intervention/manipulation on either reader ability or text complexity or a conjoint intervention on both simultaneously to yield a successful prediction of the resultant observed outcome (count correct). We conjecture that when this type of manipulation is introduced for individual reader text encounters and model predictions are consistent with observations, the quantitative hypothesis is sustained.},

  abstract = {This paper outlines a hierarchical Bayesian framework for interoception, homeostatic/allostatic control, and meta-cognition that connects fatigue and depression to the experience of chronic dyshomeostasis. Specifically, viewing interoception as the inversion of a generative model of viscerosensory inputs allows for a formal definition of dyshomeostasis (as chronically enhanced surprise about bodily signals, or, equivalently, low evidence for the brain's model of bodily states) and allostasis (as a change in prior beliefs or predictions which define setpoints for homeostatic reflex arcs). Critically, we propose that the performance of interoceptive-allostatic circuitry is monitored by a metacognitive layer that updates beliefs about the brain's capacity to successfully regulate bodily states (allostatic self-efficacy). In this framework, fatigue and depression can be understood as sequential responses to the interoceptive experience of dyshomeostasis and the ensuing metacognitive diagnosis of low allostatic self-efficacy. While fatigue might represent an early response with adaptive value (cf. sickness behavior), the experience of chronic dyshomeostasis may trigger a generalized belief of low self-efficacy and lack of control (cf. learned helplessness), resulting in depression. This perspective implies alternative pathophysiological mechanisms that are reflected by differential abnormalities in the effective connectivity of circuits for interoception and allostasis. We discuss suitably extended models of effective connectivity that could distinguish these connectivity patterns in individual patients and may help inform differential diagnosis of fatigue and depression in the future.},

Survey, assessment, and test scores in educational and psychological measurement are often interpreted in ways that assume a concatenation of units to have been established, even though these assumptions are rarely stated or tested. A concatenation model for measurement is shown to be equivalent to a Rasch model: any two units of measurement placed end to end must together be of the same length as either one of them added to itself. This additive principle and a concatenation model of measurement together serve as a heuristic guide for organizing two experimental approaches to calibrating instruments for measuring length. The capacity to reproduce the unit of measurement from theory with no need for repeated empirical calibration experiments, as in the geometrical bisection of the line and the resultant halving of the length measure, is highlighted as essential to demonstrating a thorough understanding of the construct.},

Seventeen resistance-trained men (mean\textpm SD age=21\textpm 2 years) visited the laboratory on two occasions.

  abstract = {Background: There is a lack of research considering acute fatigue responses to high- and low-load resistance training as well as the comparison between male and female responses. Furthermore, limited studies have considered fatigue response testing with the inclusion of perceptions of discomfort and exertion. Methods: The present study included males (n~=~9; 23.8 \textpm{} 6.4 years; 176.7 \textpm{} 6.2 cm; 73.9 \textpm{} 9.3 kg) and females (n~=~8; 21.3 \textpm{} 0.9 years; 170.5 \textpm{} 6.1 cm; 65.5 \textpm{} 10.8 kg) who were assessed for differences in fatigue (i.e., loss of torque at maximal voluntary contraction (MVC)) immediately following isolated lumbar extension (ILEX) exercise at heavy- (HL) and light-(LL) loads (80\% and 50\% MVC, respectively). Participants also reported perceptual measures of effort (RPE-E) and discomfort (RPE-D) between different resistance training protocols. Results: Analysis of variance revealed significantly greater absolute and relative fatigue following LL compared to HL conditions (p~{$<~$}0.001). Absolute fatigue significantly differed between males and females (p = 0.012), though relative fatigue was not significantly different (p = 0.160). However, effect sizes for absolute fatigue (HL; Males = -1.84, Females = -0.83; LL; Males = -3.11, Females = -2.39) and relative fatigue (HL; Males = -2.17, Females = -0.76; LL; Males = -3.36, Females = -3.08) were larger for males in both HL and LL conditions. RPE-E was maximal for all participants in both conditions, but RPE-D was significantly higher in LL compared to HL (p~{$<~$}0.001) with no difference between males and females. Discussion: Our data suggests that females do not incur the same degree of fatigue as males following similar exercise protocols, and indeed that females might be able to sustain longer exercise duration at the same relative loads. As such females should manipulate training variables accordingly, perhaps performing greater repetitions at a relative load, or using heavier relative loads than males. Furthermore, since lighter load exercise is often prescribed in rehabilitation settings (particularly for the lumbar extensors) it seems prudent to know that this might not be necessary to strengthen musculature and indeed might be contraindicated to avoid the increased fatigue and discomfort associated with LL exercise.},

There is little agreement about what constitutes strong versus weak theory in the social sciences, but there is more consensus that references, data, variables, diagrams, and hypotheses are not theory. Despite this consensus, however, authors routinely use these five elements in lieu of theory. We explain how each of these five elements can be confused with theory and how to avoid such confusion. By making this consensus explicit, we hope to help authors avoid some of the most common and easily averted problems that lead readers to view papers as having inadequate theory. We then discuss how journals might facilitate the publication of stronger theory. We suggest that if the field is serious about producing stronger theory, journals need to reconsider their empirical requirements. We argue that journals ought to be more receptive to papers that test part rather than all of a theory and use illustrative rather than definitive data.},

This study aimed to: (i) critically evaluate the ways in which recent research in sport psychology has defined elite/expert athletes; (ii) explore the rationale for using such athletes; and (iii) evaluate the conclusions that research in this field draws about the nature of expertise. Design Conventional systematic review principles were employed to conduct a rigorous search and synthesise findings. Methods A comprehensive literature search of SPORTDiscus, Academic Search Complete, PsycINFO, and PsycARTICLES was completed in September, 2013 which yielded 91 empirical studies published between 2010 and 2013. The primarily qualitative findings were analysed thematically. Results Eight ways of defining elite/expert athletes were identified, ranging from Olympic champions to regional level competitors and those with as little as two years of experience in their sport. Three types of rationale were evident in these studies (i.e., ``necessity'', ``exploratory'' and ``superior''); while findings also indicated that some elite athletes are psychologically idiosyncratic and perhaps even dysfunctional in their behaviour. Finally, only 19 of the 91 included studies provided conclusions about the nature of expertise in sport. Conclusions This study suggests that the definitions of elite athletes vary on a continuum of validity, and the findings are translated into a taxonomy for classifying expert samples in sport psychology research in future. Recommendations are provided for researchers in this area.},

  abstract = {The concept of personalized nutrition and exercise prescription represents a topical and exciting progression for the discipline given the large inter-individual variability that exists in response to virtually all performance and health related interventions. Appropriate interpretation of intervention-based data from an individual or group of individuals requires practitioners and researchers to consider a range of concepts including the confounding influence of measurement error and biological variability. In addition, the means to quantify likely statistical and practical improvements are facilitated by concepts such as confidence intervals (CIs) and smallest worthwhile change (SWC). The purpose of this review is to provide accessible and applicable recommendations for practitioners and researchers that interpret, and report personalized data. To achieve this, the review is structured in three sections that progressively develop a statistical framework. Section 1 explores fundamental concepts related to measurement error and describes how typical error and CIs can be used to express uncertainty in baseline measurements. Section 2 builds upon these concepts and demonstrates how CIs can be combined with the concept of SWC to assess whether meaningful improvements occur post-intervention. Finally, section 3 introduces the concept of biological variability and discusses the subsequent challenges in identifying individual response and non-response to an intervention. Worked numerical examples and interactive Supplementary Material are incorporated to solidify concepts and assist with implementation in practice.},

  abstract = {The standard fitness-fatigue model (FFM) is known to include several limitations described by the linearity assumption, the independence assumption, and the deterministic assumption. These limitations ensure that the modelled response to chronic training does not match the complexity observed in practice. The purpose of part II of this review series was to describe previous extensions to the standard FFM to address these limitations, providing key mathematical insights and resources to both explain technical elements and enable researchers and practitioners to fit these extended models to their own data. To address the linearity assumption of the standard FFM and the associated limitation that doubling the training load predicts twice the performance improvement, two distinct extensions are reviewed including the addition of a non-linear transform to training inputs and inclusion of non-linear terms within the system of differential equations. To address the independence assumption where the response to a training session is unaffected by previous sessions, a popular extension where fatigue is updated as an exponentially weighted moving average of previous training loads is reviewed. Finally, the review introduces the concept of state-space models where uncertainty in the estimates of fitness, fatigue and performance measurement can be directly modelled eliminating the unsuited deterministic assumption of the standard FFM. The review also highlights how state-space models can be further expanded to include features such as the Kalman filter where parameter estimates can be updated with incoming performance measurements to better predict and manipulate training to optimise performance. Collectively, the range of topics covered in this review series and the resources provided should enable researchers and practitioners to better investigate the extensive area of FFMs and determine in what contexts models can assist with training monitoring and prescription.},

  abstract = {There exists conceptual confusion in the psychological measurement literature. One such example is the nonsense of the question, ?are psychological attributes quantitative?? when referring to nontechnical psychological phenomena. Rather than debating whether this is an empirical or conceptual question, the issue of concern should be whether it makes sense to ask it. As illuminated by Wittgenstein almost a century ago, the concepts of psychology are everyday concepts rather than technical ones. However, the enduring comparison of psychology with the physical sciences leads to the adoption of technical language that loses its meaning when used with the aim of explaining everyday concepts. For this reason, asking whether psychological attributes are quantitative is, in many cases, a nonsensical question to ask.},

In the 1950s and 60s, Bohm took a direction unheard of for a professor of theoretical physics: while still researching in physics, working among others with Yakir Aharanov and later Jeffrey Bub, he also spent time studying ``metaphysics''---such as Hegel's dialectics and Indian panpsychism. 50 years on, questions raised about the direction and philosophical assumptions of theoretical physics show that Bohm's arguments still have contemporary relevance.},

  abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: What is the recommended assessment and management of those with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), based on the best available evidence, clinical expertise, and consumer preference? SUMMARY ANSWER: International evidence-based guidelines address prioritized questions and outcomes and include 254 recommendations and practice points, to promote consistent, evidence-based care and improve the experience and health outcomes in PCOS. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The 2018 International PCOS Guideline was independently evaluated as high quality and integrated multidisciplinary and consumer perspectives from six continents; it is now used in 196 countries and is widely cited. It was based on best available, but generally very low to low quality, evidence. It applied robust methodological processes and addressed shared priorities. The guideline transitioned from consensus based to evidence-based diagnostic criteria and enhanced accuracy of diagnosis, whilst promoting consistency of care. However, diagnosis is still delayed, the needs of those with PCOS are not being adequately met, evidence quality was low and evidence-practice gaps persist. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The 2023 International Evidence-based Guideline update reengaged the 2018 network across professional societies and consumer organizations with multidisciplinary experts and women with PCOS directly involved at all stages. Extensive evidence synthesis was completed. Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation-II (AGREEII)-compliant processes were followed. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) framework was applied across evidence quality, feasibility, acceptability, cost, implementation and ultimately recommendation strength and diversity and inclusion were considered throughout. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: This summary should be read in conjunction with the full Guideline for detailed participants and methods. Governance included a six-continent international advisory and management committee, five guideline development groups, and paediatric, consumer, and translation committees. Extensive consumer engagement and guideline experts informed the update scope and priorities. Engaged international society-nominated panels included paediatrics, endocrinology, gynaecology, primary care, reproductive endocrinology, obstetrics, psychiatry, psychology, dietetics, exercise physiology, obesity care, public health and other experts, alongside consumers, project management, evidence synthesis, statisticians and translation experts. Thirty-nine professional and consumer organizations covering 71 countries engaged in the process. Twenty meetings and five face-to-face forums over 12 months addressed 58 prioritized clinical questions involving 52 systematic and 3 narrative reviews. Evidence-based recommendations were developed and approved via consensus across five guideline panels, modified based on international feedback and peer review, independently reviewed for methodological rigour, and approved by the Australian Government National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: The evidence in the assessment and management of PCOS has generally improved in the past five years, but remains of low to moderate quality. The technical evidence report and analyses ({$\sim$}6000 pages) underpins 77 evidence-based and 54 consensus recommendations, with 123 practice points. Key updates include: i) further refinement of individual diagnostic criteria, a simplified diagnostic algorithm and inclusion of anti-M\"ullerian hormone (AMH) levels as an alternative to ultrasound in adults only; ii) strengthening recognition of broader features of PCOS including metabolic risk factors, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, very high prevalence of psychological features, and high risk status for adverse outcomes during pregnancy; iii) emphasizing the poorly recognized, diverse burden of disease and the need for greater healthcare professional education, evidence-based patient information, improved models of care and shared decision making to improve patient experience, alongside greater research; iv) maintained emphasis on healthy lifestyle, emotional wellbeing and quality of life, with awareness and consideration of weight stigma; and v) emphasizing evidence-based medical therapy and cheaper and safer fertility management. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Overall, recommendations are strengthened and evidence is improved, but remain generally low to moderate quality. Significantly greater research is now needed in this neglected, yet common condition. Regional health system variation was considered and acknowledged, with a further process for guideline and translation resource adaptation provided. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The 2023 International Guideline for the Assessment and Management of PCOS provides clinicians and patients with clear advice on best practice, based on the best available evidence, expert multidisciplinary input and consumer preferences. Research recommendations have been generated and a comprehensive multifaceted dissemination and translation programme supports the Guideline with an integrated evaluation program. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This effort was primarily funded by the Australian Government via the National Health Medical Research Council (NHMRC) (APP1171592), supported by a partnership with American Society for Reproductive Medicine, Endocrine Society, European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology, and the European Society for Endocrinology. The Commonwealth Government of Australia also supported Guideline translation through the Medical Research Future Fund (MRFCRI000266). HJT and AM are funded by NHMRC fellowships. JT is funded by a Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) fellowship. Guideline development group members were volunteers. Travel expenses were covered by the sponsoring organizations. Disclosures of interest were strictly managed according to NHMRC policy and are available with the full guideline, technical evidence report, peer review and responses (www.monash.edu/medicine/mchri/pcos).

Indeed, a great part of the discussion is relevant to the problems of anthropometry and vital statistics.

  abstract = {Zusammenfassung Ich habe in diesem Aufsatz kurz anzudeuten versucht, was meiner Ansicht nach das Wesentliche in Fragestellung und Methode der Ethologie ist und weshalb wir in Konrad Lorenz den Begr\"under moderner Ethologie erblicken. Hierbei habe ich vielleicht das Arbeitsgebiet der Ethologie weiter gefa\ss t, als unter Ethologen gebr\"auchlich ist. Wenn man aber die vielartige Arbeit jener Forscher \"ubersieht, die sich Ethologen nennen, ist man zu dieser weiten Fassung geradezu gezwungen. Ich habe in meiner Darstellung weder Vollst\"andigkeit noch Gleichgewicht angestrebt und, um zur Fortf\"uhrung des Gespr\"achs anzuregen, ruhig meine Steckenpferde geritten, vor allem das Verh\"altnis zwischen Ethologie und Physiologie, die Gefahr der Vernachl\"assigung der Frage der Arterhaltung, Fragen der Methodik der ontogenetischen Forschung, und Aufgaben und Methoden der Evolutionsforschung. Bei der Einsch\"atzung des Anteils, den Lorenz an der Entwicklung der Ethologie genommen hat und noch nimmt, habe ich als seinen Hauptbeitrag den bezeichnet, da\ss{} er uns gezeigt hat, wie man bew\"ahrtes ``biologisches Denken'' folgerichtig auf Verhalten anwenden kann. Da\ss{} er dabei an die Arbeit seiner Vorg\"anger angekn\"upft hat, ist nicht mehr verwunderlich, als da\ss{} jeder Vater selbst einen Vater hat. Insbesondere scheint mir das Wesentliche an Lorenz` Arbeit zu sein, da\ss{} er klar gesehen hat, da\ss{} Verhaltensweisen Teile von ``Organen'', von Systemen der Arterhaltung sind; da\ss{} ihre Verursachung genau so exakt untersucht werden kann wie die gleich welcher anderer Lebensvorg\"ange, da\ss{} ihr arterhaltender Wert ebenso systematisch und exakt aufweisbar ist wie ihre Verursachung, da\ss{} Verhaltensontogenie in grunds\"atzlich gleicher Weise erforscht werden kann wie die Ontogenie der Form und da\ss{} die Erforschung der Verhaltensevolution der Untersuchung der Strukturevolution parallel geht. Und obwohl Lorenz ein riesiges Tatsachenmaterial gesammelt hat, ist die Ethologie doch noch mehr durch seine Fragestellung und durch k\"uhne Hypothesen gef\"ordert als durch eigene Nachpr\"ufung dieser Hypothesen. Ohne den Wert solcher Nachpr\"ufung zu untersch\"atzen --- ohne die es nat\"urlich keine Weiterentwicklung g\"abe --- m\"ochte ich doch behaupten, da\ss{} die durch Nachpr\"ufung notwendig gewordenen Modifikationen neben der Leistung des urspr\"unglichen Ansatzes vergleichsweise unbedeutend sind. Nebenbei sei auch daran erinnert, da\ss{} eine der vielen heilsamen Nachwirkungen der Lorenzschen Arbeit das wachsende Interesse ist, das die Humanpsychologie der Ethologie entgegenbringt - ein erster Ansatz einer Entwicklung, deren Tragweite wir noch kaum \"ubersehen k\"onnen. Am Schlu\ss{} noch eine Bemerkung zur Terminologie. Ich habe hier das Wort ``Ethologie'' auf einen Riesenkomplex von Wissenschaften angewandt, von denen manche, wie Psychologie und Physiologie, schon l\"angst anerkannte Namen tragen. Das hei\ss t nat\"urlich nicht, da\ss{} ich den Namen Ethologie f\"ur dieses ganze Gebiet vorschlagen will; das w\"are geschichtlich einfach falsch, weil das Wort historisch nur die Arbeit einer kleinen Gruppe von Zoologen kennzeichnet. Der Name ist nat\"urlich gleichg\"ultig; worauf es mir vor allem ankommt, ist darzutun, da\ss{} wir das Zusammenwachsen vieler Einzeldisziplinen zu einer vielumfassenden Wissenschaft erleben, f\"ur die es nur einen richtigen Namen gibt: ``Verhaltensbiologie''. Selbstverst\"andlich ist diese synthetische Entwicklung nicht die Arbeit eines Mannes oder gar die der Ethologen. Sie ist die Folge einer allgemeinen Neigung, Br\"ucken zwischen verwandten Wissenschaften zu schlagen, einer Neigung, die sich in vielen Disziplinen entwickelt hat. Unter den Zoologen ist es Lorenz, der hierzu am meisten beigetragen und zudem manche Nachbardisziplinen st\"arker beeinflu\ss t hat als irgendein anderer. Ich bin sogar davon \"uberzeugt, da\ss{} diese Einwirkungen auf Nachbarwissenschaften noch lange anhalten werden und da\ss{} die Verhaltensbiologie erst am Anfang ihrer Ontogenie steht.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Few studies have explored in vivo insulin action on substrate use in women with PCOS. In particular, no data are available in women with different PCOS phenotypes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate insulin action on glucose (Gox) and lipid (Lox) oxidation, nonoxidative glucose metabolism (Gnonox), and serum free fatty acids (FFAs) in different PCOS phenotypes. METHODS: Participants included 187 nondiabetic women with PCOS diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria. Data from a historical sample of 20 healthy women were used as reference values. Whole-body substrate use data were obtained by the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp associated with indirect calorimetry. Serum androgens were assessed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and equilibrium dialysis. RESULTS: During hyperinsulinemia, the increase of Gox ({$\Delta$}Gox), Gnonox, as well as the suppression of Lox ({$\Delta$}Lox) and serum FFA ({$\Delta\%$} FFA) were altered in each PCOS phenotype. Moreover, Gnonox and {$\Delta\%$} FFA were lower in women with the classic phenotype than in those with the ovulatory or the normoandrogenic phenotypes, and {$\Delta$}Gox was lower in women with the classic than in those with the ovulatory phenotype. In multivariable analysis fat mass and free testosterone were independent predictors of {$\Delta$}Gox, Gnonox, and {$\Delta\%$} FFA, whereas only fat mass predicted {$\Delta$}Lox. CONCLUSION: In women with PCOS, regardless of phenotype, insulin-mediated substrate use is impaired. This phenomenon is greater in individuals with the classic phenotype. Free testosterone plays an independent role in insulin action abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism.},

  abstract = {STUDY QUESTION: Is resting energy expenditure (REE) altered in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)? SUMMARY ANSWER: Women with PCOS have a reduction in REE, when corrected for fat-free mass, independent of PCOS clinical phenotypes and BMI categories. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Obesity is an important issue in women with PCOS, in terms of frequency and pathophysiological implications. It has been hypothesized that obesity may be favoured by alterations in REE, but the studies have been limited and conflicting. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This case-control study was a comparison of 266 women with PCOS and 51 healthy controls, recruited in the Verona 3P study from 2010 to 2021. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Women with PCOS diagnosed by the Rotterdam criteria, with normal thyroid function and no interfering medications, were referred to the outpatient clinic of a tertiary care centre of endocrinology and metabolism for a measurement of REE. Healthy controls were recruited in the same period and submitted to the same procedure. In all subjects, REE was measured by indirect calorimetry and serum androgens were measured by LC-MS/MS. In women with PCOS, insulin sensitivity was assessed using the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: REE was similar in women with PCOS and controls. However, REE corrected for fat-free mass (REE/FFM) was significantly lower in women with PCOS than in controls (31.8\,\textpm\,4.0 vs 35.4\,\textpm\,3.9~kcal/kgFFM{$\cdot$}day, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). REE/FFM did not differ between normal-weight, overweight, or obese women with PCOS, and each of these subgroups showed lower REE/FFM values than controls. Reduced REE/FFM values were found in each phenotype of the syndrome. In multiple regression analysis, REE/FFM was independently associated with age and PCOS status, but not with fat mass. In PCOS women, REE/FFM was independently and directly associated with ovarian follicle number. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Limitations of the study are the cross-sectional design, which limits the causal inference of the results, and the unavailability of precise information about lifestyle factors, which may be potential confounders. Further prospective studies are needed to establish the importance of this phenomenon in contributing to the weight excess of PCOS. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: A reduction of REE could potentially favour weight gain in women with PCOS and possibly contribute to the altered metabolic profile typical of this condition, even counteracting the therapeutic strategies aimed to reduce excess body fat in these women. Nevertheless, the presence of this abnormality in both obese/overweight and normal-weight patients suggests that other factors must play a role in this phenomenon. STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This work was supported by academic grants to PM from the University of Verona (FUR 2010-2022). All authors declare no conflict of interest.

First, the ambiguous terminology identified by Franz in the measurement debate is not inherent to the debate itself, but reflects a biased understanding of the empirical meaning of axioms of measurement. Second, the problem of ?hidden? or ?unobservable? phenomena described by Franz as the root of conceptual confusion is not unique to psychology, but can also be found in physics. Therefore, it cannot be the cause for the failure to establish measurement in psychology. This comment concludes with the statement that, though both conceptual and empirical analyses are useful, Franz?s general claim that the former supersedes the latter must be rejected as inaccurate.},

Design/methodology/approach The paper draws its inferences from Google NGram Viewer and five digitised historical newspaper databases -- The Times of India, The Financial Times, The Economist, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal -- that contain prints from the nineteenth century. Findings The paper argues that corpus linguistics or the quantitative and qualitative analysis of large-scale real-world machine-readable text can be an important method of historical research in management studies, especially for discourse analysis. It shows how this method can be fruitfully used for research in management and organisational history, using term count and cluster analysis. In particular, historical databases of digitised newspapers serve as important corpora to understand the evolution of specific words and concepts. Corpus linguistics using newspaper archives can potentially serve as a method for periodisation and triangulation in corporate, analytically structured and serial histories and also foster cross-country comparisons in the evolution of management concepts. Research limitations/implications The paper also shows the limitation of the research method and potential robustness checks while using the method. Practical implications Findings of this paper can stimulate new ways of conducting research in management history. Originality/value The paper for the first time introduces corpus linguistics as a research method in management history.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Physical function is shown to decline with age. However, how long-term strength training may attenuate the age-related limitation in functional tasks with various force demands is unclear. METHODS: In a cross-sectional study, we assessed maximal muscle strength, initial and late phase rate of force development (RFD), as well as 4 tests of functional performance in 11 strength-trained master athletes (MAs), 11 recreationally active older adults (AEs), 10 sedentary older adults (SOAs), and 9 moderately active young controls. Functional performance was divided into 2 categories: more force-demanding (chair-rising ability and stair-climbing power) and less force-demanding (habitual walking speed and 1-leg standing) tasks. RESULTS: MA exhibited 75\%, 45\%, and 26\% higher leg press maximal strength compared with SOA, AE, and young, respectively (P {$<$} .01). MA leg press RFD was not different from young, but was higher compared to AE and SOA during both the initial (0-50 ms: 104\%-177\%, P {$<$} .05) and late phase (100-200 ms: 37\%-52\%, P {$<$} .05) of muscle contraction. MA also showed better mean (SD) performance compared with AE and SOA (P {$<$} .05) in more force-demanding functional tasks; chair-rising ability (MA: 6.2 (1.2) seconds; AE: 8.6 (1.8) seconds; SOA: 9.7 (3.0) seconds; young: 6.5 (1.0) seconds) and stair-climbing power (MA: 701 (161) W; AE: 556 (104) W; SOA: 495 (116) W; young: 878 (126) W). No differences (mean (SD)) were observed between MA and AE in less force-demanding tasks, but both groups were superior (P {$<$} .05) compared with SOA in walking speed (MA: 1.49 (0.21) m{$\cdot$}s; AE: 1.56 (0.17) m{$\cdot$}s; SOA: 1.27 (0.22) m{$\cdot$}s; young: 1.62 (0.22) m{$\cdot$}s) and balance test completion (MA: 45\%; AE: 45\%; SOA: 0\%; young: 100\%). CONCLUSION: Our results reveal that maintaining a high muscle force-generating capacity into older age is related to beneficial effects on functional performance, which may not be achieved with recreational activity, thus highlighting strength training as an important contribution to healthy aging.},

The long-held belief that experimental standardization begets replicability has also been recently challenged, with the observation that the reduction of variability within studies can lead to idiosyncratic, lab-specific results that cannot be replicated. An alternative approach is to, instead, deliberately introduce heterogeneity, known as ``heterogenization'' of experimental design. Here, we explore a novel perspective in the heterogenization program in a meta-analysis of variability in observed phenotypic outcomes in both control and experimental animal models of ischemic stroke. First, by quantifying interindividual variability across control groups, we illustrate that the amount of heterogeneity in disease state (infarct volume) differs according to methodological approach, for example, in disease induction methods and disease models. We argue that such methods may improve replicability by creating diverse and representative distribution of baseline disease state in the reference group, against which treatment efficacy is assessed. Second, we illustrate how meta-analysis can be used to simultaneously assess efficacy and stability (i.e., mean effect and among-individual variability). We identify treatments that have efficacy and are generalizable to the population level (i.e., low interindividual variability), as well as those where there is high interindividual variability in response; for these, latter treatments translation to a clinical setting may require nuance. We argue that by embracing rather than seeking to minimize variability in phenotypic outcomes, we can motivate the shift toward heterogenization and improve both the replicability and generalizability of preclinical research.},

  abstract = {Purpose\enspace{} The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a 15-week partial range of motion (ROM) resistance training program on the vastus lateralis (VL) architecture and mechanical properties, when the time under tension (TUT) was equalized. Methods\enspace{} Nineteen untrained male subjects were randomly assigned to a control (Control; n\,=\,8) or training (TG; n\,=\,11) group. In the TG, the dominant and nondominant legs were randomly selected to be trained with a full ROM (FULL) or a partial ROM (PART) in an isokinetic dynamometer. Training volume was equalized based on the TUT by manipulating sets and repetitions. The VL muscle architecture was assessed by B-mode ultrasonography at rest and during maximal isometric knee extension contractions (MVCs) at ten knee angles. The VL fascicle force and specific tension were calculated from the MVCs with superimposed stimuli, accounting for the moment arm length, muscle architecture, and antagonist coactivation. Results\enspace{} The FULL training induced changes in fascicle length (FL) (4.9\,\textpm\,2.0\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and specific tension (25.8\,\textpm\,18.7\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). There was a moderate effect of PART training on the physiological cross-sectional area (PCSA) (7.8\,\textpm\,4.0\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.001, dav = 0.6) and torque--angle adaptations (average increase 17.7\,\textpm\,3.9\%, P\,{$<$}\,0.05). Conclusions\enspace{} These results provide evidence that crucial architectural and mechanical muscle adaptations are dependent on the ROM used in strength training. It seems that muscle FL and specific tension can be increased by pure concentric training if greater ROM is used. Conversely, restricting the ROM to shorter muscle lengths promotes a greater PCSA and angle-specific strength adaptations.},

We add to this development a crucial but in psychology hitherto underappreciated contingency: There are mathematical limits to the magnitudes that population effect sizes can take within the common multivariate context in which psychology is situated, and these limits can be far more restrictive than typically assumed. The implication is that some hypothesized or preregistered effect sizes may be impossible. At the same time, these restrictions offer a way of statistically triangulating the plausible range of unknown effect sizes. We explain the reason for the existence of these limits, illustrate how to identify them, and offer recommendations and tools for improving hypothesized effect sizes by exploiting the broader multivariate context in which they occur.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To examine if exercise referral schemes (ERSs) are associated with meaningful changes in health and well-being in a large cohort of individuals throughout England, Scotland, and Wales from the National Referral Database. METHODS: Data were obtained from 23\,731 participants from 13 different ERSs lasting 6 weeks to 3 months. Changes from pre- to post-ERS in health and well-being outcomes were examined including body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP)), resting heart rate (RHR), short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS), WHO Well-Being Index (WHO-5), Exercise Related Quality of Life scale (ERQoL), and Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale (ESES). Two-stage individual patient data meta-analysis was used to generate effect estimates. RESULTS: Estimates (95\% CIs) revealed statistically significant changes occurred compared with point nulls for BMI (-0.55\,kg.m2 (-0.69 to -0.41)), SBP (-2.95\,mmHg (-3.97 to -1.92)), SWEMWBS (2.99 pts (1.61 to 4.36)), WHO-5 (8.78 pts (6.84 to 10.63)), ERQoL (15.26 pts (4.71 to 25.82)), and ESES (2.58 pts (1.76 to 3.40)), but not RHR (0.22 f c (-1.57 to 1.12)) or DBP (-0.93\,mmHg (-1.51 to -0.35)). However, comparisons of estimates (95\% CIs) against null intervals suggested the majority of outcomes may not improve meaningfully. CONCLUSIONS: We considered whether meaningful health and well-being changes occur in people who are undergoing ERSs. These results demonstrate that, although many health and well-being outcomes improved, the changes did not achieve meaningful levels. This suggests the need to consider the implementation of ERSs more critically to discern how to maximise their effectiveness.},

This study assessed change in PA levels and mental well-being after a motivational interviewing (MI) community-based PA intervention and the impact of signposting (SP) and social action (SA) (i.e. weekly group support) pathways. METHODS: Participants (n~=~2084) took part in a community-based, primary care PA programme using MI techniques. Self-reported PA and mental well-being data were collected at baseline (following an initial 30-min MI appointment), 12 weeks, 6 months and 12 months. Participants were assigned based upon the surgery they attended to the SP or SA pathway. Multilevel models derived point estimates and 95\% confidence intervals for outcomes at each time point and change scores. RESULTS: Participants increased PA and mental well-being at each follow-up time point through both participant pathways and with little difference between pathways. Retention was similar between pathways at 12 weeks, but the SP pathway retained more participants at 6 and 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Both pathways produced similar improvements in PA and mental well-being; however, the addition of a control would have provided further insight as to the effectiveness. Due to lower resources yet similar effects, the SP pathway could be incorporated to support PA in primary care settings.},

Despite this popularity, or perhaps because of it, most psychologists are not aware of the statistical peculiarities of thep value procedure. In particular,p values are based on data that were never observed, and these hypothetical data are themselves influenced by subjective intentions. Moreover,p values do not quantify statistical evidence. This article reviews thesep value problems and illustrates each problem with concrete examples. The three problems are familiar to statisticians but may be new to psychologists. A practical solution to thesep value problems is to adopt a model selection perspective and use the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) for statistical inference (Raftery, 1995). The BIC provides an approximation to a Bayesian hypothesis test, does not require the specification of priors, and can be easily calculated from SPSS output.},

  abstract = {Summary The purpose of this study was to examine whether inter- and intramuscular differences in hypertrophy induced by resistance training correspond to differences in muscle activation during the first training session. Eleven young men completed 12 weeks of training intervention for knee extension. Before and after the intervention, T1-weighted magnetic resonance ( MR ) images were recorded to determine the volume and anatomical cross-sectional area ( CSA ) along the length of the individual muscles of the quadriceps femoris. The T2-weighted MR images were also acquired before and immediately after the first training session. The T2 was calculated for each pixel within the quadriceps femoris, from which the muscle activation was evaluated as \%activated volume and area. The results showed that the \%activated volume after the first training session was significantly higher in the vastus intermedius than the vastus medialis. However, the relative change in muscle volume after the training intervention was significantly greater in the rectus femoris than the vasti muscles (vastus lateralis, intermedius and medialis). Within the rectus femoris, both the \%activated area and relative increase in CSA  were significantly greater in the distal region than the proximal region. In contrast, the \%activated area and relative increase in CSA of the vasti were nearly uniform along each muscle. These results suggest that the muscle activation during the first training session is associated with the intramuscular difference in hypertrophy induced by training intervention, but not with the intermuscular difference.},

Psychology requires a strong conceptual component because it is subject to unusual distortions and self-deceptions in theory formation and evidential evaluation due to issues of power, self-esteem, and social ideology. I agree with Wachtel that pressures for quantity of publication are detrimental to scientific quality, but dispute his suggestion that excessive focus on quantity in assessing productivity can be addressed by having tenure and promotion candidates submit only their three best papers. Such reviews must be based on the entire record, so improvements must involve journals' acceptance standards. Regarding Wachtel's concern about the influence of grants on reviews, I argue that grants should be relevant only to the extent they bear on the candidate's scholarly goals.},

  abstract = {The present study determined the effects of muscular endurance strength training on maximum strength and power, functional capacity, muscle activation and hypertrophy in older men and women. Eighty-one men and women acted as an intervention group while 22 acted as non-training controls (age range 64-75 y). Intervention training included super-sets (i.e., paired exercises, immediately performing the second exercises following completion of the first) with short rest intervals (30-60 s between sets) at an intensity of 50-60\% one-repetition maximum (1-RM) for 15-20 repetitions. Concentric leg press actions measured maximum strength (1-RM) and concentric peak power. Functional capacity was assessed by maximum speed walking tests (i.e., forward walk, backward walk, timed-up-and-go, and stair climb tests). Quadriceps muscle activation was assessed by surface electromyogram and twitch interpolation technique. Vastus lateralis cross-sectional area was measured by panoramic ultrasound. Compared to control, the intervention groups increased maximum strength (1-RM; men: 10 \textpm{} 7\% vs. 2 \textpm{} 3\%, women: 14 \textpm{} 9\% vs. 1 \textpm{} 6\% both P {$<$} 0.01) and vastus lateralis cross-sectional area (men: 6 \textpm{} 7\% vs. -3 \textpm{} 6\%, women: 10 \textpm{} 10\% vs. 0 \textpm{} 4\% both P {$<$} 0.05). But there were no between-group differences in peak power, muscle activation or functional capacity (e.g., stair climb; men: -5 \textpm{} 7\% vs. -4 \textpm{} 3\%, women: -5 \textpm{} 6\% vs. -2 \textpm{} 5\% both P {$>$} 0.05). While benefits occurred during muscular endurance strength training, specific stimuli are probably needed to target all aspects of age-related health.},

  abstract = {Background: The body of literature considering caffeine as an ergogenic aid has primarily considered typically aerobic based exercise, male participants and moderate-to large-caffeine doses. With this in mind the aim of this project was to explore the effects of a low-caffeine dose upon maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) and muscular endurance (time to task failure, TTF) at heavier-and lighter-loads. Methods: Nineteen physically active, habitual caffeine consuming females randomly performed four testing conditions; two with a low-dose of caffeine (100 mg equating to mean = 1.5 \textpm{} 0.18 mg{$\cdot$}kg-1) and two placebo conditions, where they performed a maximal strength test (MVC) knee extension at 45{$^\circ$} followed by a task of relative muscular endurance (sustained isometric contraction for TTF) using either heavier-(70\% MVC) and lighter-(30\% MVC) loads. Each participant performed each load condition following both caffeine and placebo consumption. Immediately following cessation of the muscular endurance test participants were asked to report their rating of perceived effort (RPE) and rating of perceived discomfort (RPD). Results: Analyses revealed a significant effect for caffeine upon MVC compared to placebo (p = 0.007). We also found a significantly greater TTF for the lighter-compared to the heavier-load condition (p {$<$} 0.0001); however, there was no significant effect comparing caffeine to placebo (p = 0.2368), but insufficient precision of estimates to infer equivalence in either lighter-(p = 0.750) or heavier-load (p = 0.262) conditions. There were no statistically significant effects for caffeine compared with placebo, or lighter-compared with heavier-loads, for RPE and RPD (all p {$>$} 0.05). RPE was statistically equivalent between caffeine and placebo for both lighter-(p = 0.007) and heavier-load (p = 0.002) conditions and RPD for heavier-(p = 0.006) but not lighter-load (p = 0.136). Discussion: This is the first study to demonstrate a positive effect on strength from a low caffeine dose in female participants. However, it is unclear whether caffeine positively impacts upon relative muscular endurance in either heavier-or lighter-loads. Further, both RPE and RPD appear to be relatively similar during isometric tasks performed to task failure independently of caffeine supplementation or load. These findings may have implications for persons wishing to avoid side-effects or withdrawal symptoms associated with larger caffeine doses whilst still attaining the positive strength responses.},

RESULTS: A formal proof of the discovery by De Vet et~al. is presented. It is also proved that, vice versa, the SB formula can be used to transform certain ICCs for average measurements into the corresponding ICCs for single measurements. Furthermore, it is specified to which type of ICC the transformations can be applied. Finally, several illustrations of the transformations are presented. CONCLUSION: The discovery by De Vet et~al. is quite remarkable because ICCs and the SB formula come from quite different scientific disciplines.},

This pilot study examined the effects of a short-term (6wk) cold water immersion (CWI) programme on the body composition of (n=10) healthy male adults. It was hypothesized that the thermal stresses would produce reductions in fat mass (FM) and body fat percentage (BFp) as a result of thermogenic activation of the BAT mechanism. Methods: Using a single arm prospective trial design, participants were subjected to singular acute (18min) cold water exposures (15\textpm 1{$^\circ$}C) weekly for the duration of the intervention (6wk). Results: Non-significant decreases were observed in FM (-1.55\textpm 2.24kg; p = 0.057) and BFp (-1.62\textpm 2.46\%; p = 0.067), and significant increases in fat free mass (FFM; 1.46\textpm 1.68kg; p = 0.023). Conclusions: The results indicate that the intervention could be adopted as a plausible method to exert positive changes to body composition. These findings should stimulate follow up studies to examine the interventions efficacy in a larger more representative sample and examine its feasibility of implementation as a genuine obesity tackling strategy.},

When responses were missing not at random (MNAR), item parameters were severely biased, especially when the proportion of missing responses was high. Standard errors were primarily affected by sample size, with larger samples associated with smaller standard errors. Standard errors were inflated in MCAR and MAR conditions, while MNAR standard errors were similar to what they would have been, had the data been complete.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Augmented feedback is often used during resistance training to enhance acute physical performance and has shown promise as a method of improving chronic physical adaptation. However, there are inconsistencies in the scientific literature regarding the magnitude of the acute and chronic responses to feedback and the optimal method with which it is provided. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to (1) establish the evidence for the effects of feedback on acute resistance training performance and chronic training adaptations; (2) quantify the effects of feedback on acute kinematic outcomes and changes in physical adaptations; and (3) assess the effects of moderating factors on the influence of feedback during resistance training. METHODS: Twenty studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. This review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Four databases were searched, and studies were included if they were peer-reviewed investigations, written in English, and involved the provision of feedback during or following dynamic resistance exercise. Furthermore, studies must have evaluated either acute training performance or chronic physical adaptations. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified Downs and Black assessment tool. Multilevel meta-analyses were performed to quantify the effects of feedback on acute and chronic training outcomes. RESULTS: Feedback enhanced acute kinetic and kinematic outputs, muscular endurance, motivation, competitiveness, and perceived effort, while greater improvements in speed, strength, jump performance, and technical competency were reported when feedback was provided chronically. Furthermore, greater frequencies of feedback (e.g., following every repetition) were found to be most beneficial for enhancing acute performance. Results demonstrated that feedback improves acute barbell velocities by approximately 8.4\% (g\,=\,0.63, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.36-0.90). Moderator analysis revealed that both verbal (g\,=\,0.47, 95\% CI 0.22-0.71) and visual feedback (g\,=\,1.11, 95\% CI 0.61-1.61) were superior to no feedback, but visual feedback was superior to verbal feedback. For chronic outcomes, jump performance might have been positively influenced (g\,=\,0.39, 95\% CI -\,0.20 to 0.99) and short sprint performance was likely enhanced (g\,=\,0.47, 95\% CI 0.10-0.84) to a greater extent when feedback is provided throughout a training cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Feedback during resistance training can lead to enhanced acute performance within a training session and greater chronic adaptations. Studies included in our analysis demonstrated a positive influence of feedback, with all outcomes showing superior results than when no feedback is provided. For practitioners, it is recommended that high-frequency, visual feedback is consistently provided to individuals when they complete resistance training, and this may be particularly useful during periods of low motivation or when greater competitiveness is beneficial. Alternatively, researchers must be aware of the ergogenic effects of feedback on acute and chronic responses and ensure that feedback is standardised when investigating resistance training.},

J Strength Cond Res 34(11): 3157-3163, 2020-When performing resistance training, verbal kinematic feedback and visual kinematic feedback are known to enhance performance. In addition, providing verbal encouragement can assist in the attenuation of fatigue. However, the effects of these forms of feedback have never been compared. Consequently, this study aimed to quantify the effects of verbal kinematic feedback and visual kinematic feedback, and verbal encouragement on barbell velocity during the back squat. Furthermore, changes in performance were related to individual-reported conscientiousness. Twelve semiprofessional rugby union players volunteered to participate in the study that consisted of the subjects completing a set of the barbell back squat across 4 conditions (i.e., no-feedback [control], verbal feedback of kinematic information [verbal], visual feedback of kinematic information [visual], and verbal encouragement [encouragement]). In addition, participants completed a questionnaire before the study to assess conscientiousness. Magnitude-based inferences were used to assess differences between conditions, whereas Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess relationships between conscientiousness and changes in barbell velocity. All 3 forms of feedback showed almost certain improvements in barbell velocity, while differences between interventions were likely to very likely trivial. Changes in barbell velocity showed small to large inverse relationships with conscientiousness. These findings suggest that practitioners should supply kinematic feedback (verbally or visually) or, when technology is not available, provide athletes with encouraging statements while resistance training. Verbal encouragement may be of greatest benefit for individuals who demonstrate low levels of conscientiousness. Given these findings, practitioners are advised to use either technology or verbal encouragement to manipulate acute training outcomes.},

The metaanalytic-predictive (MAP) approach accounts with a hierarchical model for between-trial heterogeneity in order to derive an informative prior from historical data. In this paper, we introduce the package RBesT (R Bayesian evidence synthesis tools) which implements the MAP approach with normal (known sampling standard deviation), binomial and Poisson endpoints. The hierarchical MAP model is evaluated by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The MCMC samples representing the MAP prior are approximated with parametric mixture densities which are obtained with the expectation maximization algorithm. The parametric mixture density representation facilitates easy communication of the MAP prior and enables fast and accurate analytical procedures to evaluate properties of trial designs with informative MAP priors. The paper first introduces the framework of robust Bayesian evidence synthesis in this setting and then explains how RBesT facilitates the derivation and evaluation of an informative MAP prior from historical control data. In addition we describe how the meta-analytic framework relates to further applications including probability of success calculations.},

Efficacy was manipulated by having subjects compete against a confederate on a muscular leg-endurance task where the confederate was said to be either a varsity track athlete (low-manipulated self-efficacy) or an individual who had had knee surgery (high-manipulated self-efficacy). To create aversive consequences, the experiment was rigged so that subjects lost in competition on the two muscular leg endurance task trials they performed. Both preexisting and manipulated self-efficacy were found to significantly influence performance, with preexisting self-efficacy influencing performance only on Trial 1 and manipulated self-efficacy only on Trial 2. The findings support Bandura's (1977) theory of self-efficacy and are discussed in terms of the permeability of initial efficacy states.},

The results supported self-efficacy predictions, and thus extended Weinberg et al.'s findings to a back-to-back competitive situation. The public/private manipulation produced no significant performance effects. In addition, the sex by self-efficacy interaction indicated that the self-efficacy main effect was due primarily to high-efficacy males extending their legs significantly longer than low-efficacy males.

Because self-efficacy theory predicts that expectation-performance differences are maximized in the face of obstacles and aversive consequences, the experiment was rigged so that subjects lost in competition to the confederate on both trials. The results supported self-efficacy predictions with the high self-efficacy subjects extending their legs significantly longer than low self-efficacy subjects. Moreover, after failing on the first trial, high self-efficacy subjects extended their legs for a longer time than low self-efficacy subjects on the second trial. A postexperimental questionnaire revealed significant differences in cognitive states (e.g., expectations, attributions, self-talk) between high and low self-efficacy subjects, as well as between males and females.

Yet, despite broad interest, no unifying, operational definition of cognitive effort itself has been proposed. Here, we argue that the most intuitive and epistemologically valuable treatment is in terms of effort-based decision-making, and advocate a neuroeconomics-focused research strategy. We first outline psychological and neuroscientific theories of cognitive effort. Then we describe the benefits of a neuroeconomic research strategy, highlighting how it affords greater inferential traction than do traditional markers of cognitive effort, including self-reports and physiologic markers of autonomic arousal. Finally, we sketch a future series of studies that can leverage the full potential of the neuroeconomic approach toward understanding the cognitive and neural mechanisms that give rise to phenomenal, subjective cognitive effort.},

Willingness to expend effort was greater for participants with higher striatal dopamine synthesis capacity, whereas methylphenidate and sulpiride, a selective D2 receptor antagonist, increased cognitive motivation more for participants with lower synthesis capacity. A sequential sampling model informed by momentary gaze revealed that decisions to expend effort are related to amplification of benefit-versus-cost information attended early in the decision process, whereas the effect of benefits is strengthened with higher synthesis capacity and by methylphenidate. These findings demonstrate that methylphenidate boosts the perceived benefits versus costs of cognitive effort by modulating striatal dopamine signaling.},

Yet conflict among pragmatists has been no less sharp, leaving some to wonder whether it really makes sense to speak of ``pragmatism'' as such. It does, but only with some care. Pragmatism is best conceived less as a well-defined, tightly knit school of thought than as a loose, contentious family of thinkers who have always squabbled, and have sometimes been moved to disown one another. Indeed, the history of pragmatism can perhaps best be narrated as what Freud called the ``family romance'' of the neurotic child, in which imagined doubts about paternity and sibling rivalry are front and centre.},

Individual differences in subjective effort could present a major and pervasive confound in behavioral and neuroscience assessments, by conflating cognitive ability with cognitive motivation. Self-report cognitive effort scales have been developed, but objective measures are lacking. In this study, we use the behavioral economic approach of revealed preferences to quantify subjective effort. Specifically, we adapted a well-established discounting paradigm to measure the extent to which cognitive effort causes participants to discount monetary rewards. The resulting metrics are sensitive to both within-individual factors, including objective load and reward amount, and between-individual factors, including age and trait cognitive engagement. We further validate cognitive effort discounting by benchmarking it against well-established measures of delay discounting. The results highlight the promise and utility of behavioral economic tools for assessing trait and state influences on cognitive motivation.},

Nine female participants completed the fatiguing tasks, composed of a series of submaximal, isometric efforts (task plateaus) requiring isometric flexion at the distal interphalangeal joint of the thumb. Significant partial correlations between RPF and MVC, while controlling for task plateau intensity (\%MVC), were found in 6/9 participants. A significant linear regression model, explaining 86.2\% of the variance in mean MVC decline, was obtained with 3 predictor variables: mean RPF (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), Task Plateau (p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and the interaction between mean RPF and Task Plateau (RPF\,\texttimes\,Task Plateau; p\,=\,0.014).

  abstract = {Hypertrophy and strength are two common long-term goals of resistance training that are mediated by the manipulation of numerous variables. One training variable that is often neglected but is essential to consider for achieving strength and hypertrophy gains is the movement tempo of particular repetitions. Although research has extensively investigated the effects of different intensities, volumes, and rest intervals on muscle growth, many of the present hypertrophy guidelines do not account for different movement tempos, likely only applying to volitional movement tempos. Changing the movement tempo during the eccentric and concentric phases can influence acute exercise variables, which form the basis for chronic adaptive changes to resistance training. To further elaborate on the already unclear anecdotal evidence of different movement tempos on muscle hypertrophy and strength development, one must acknowledge that the related scientific research does not provide equivocal evidence. Furthermore, there has been no assessment of the impact of duration of particular movement phases (eccentric vs. concentric) on chronic adaptations, making it difficult to draw definitive conclusions in terms of resistance-training recommendations. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to explain how variations in movement tempo can affect chronic adaptive changes. This article provides an overview of the available scientific data describing the impact of movement tempo on hypertrophy and strength development with a thorough analysis of changes in duration of particular phases of movement. Additionally, the review provides movement tempo-specific recommendations as well real training solutions for strength and conditioning coaches and athletes, depending on their goals.},

The aim of the authors was to summarize the effectiveness of structured interventions upon PA outcomes, in addition to proportions of individuals adopting and maintaining PA, and adherence and retention rates. METHODS: Systematic review with narrative synthesis and exploratory meta-analyses. Twelve studies were included. RESULTS: Effectiveness on PA levels during adoption (pre- to first time point) showed a trivial standardized effect (0.15 [-0.06 to 0.36]); during maintenance (any time point after the first and {$>$}6~mo since initiation) the standardized effect was also trivial with a wide interval estimate (0.19 [-0.68 to 1.07]). Few studies reported adoption (k = 3) or maintenance rates (k = 2). Retention at follow-up did not differ between structured PA or controls (75.1\% [65.0\%-83.0\%] vs 75.4\% [67.0\%-82.3\%]), nor did intervention adherence (63.0\% [55.6\%-69.6\%] vs 77.8\% [19.4\%-98.1\%]). CONCLUSION: Structured PA interventions lack evidence for effectiveness in improving PA levels. Furthermore, though retention is often reported and is similar between interventions and controls, adoption, maintenance, and adherence rates were rarely reported rendering difficulty in interpreting results of effectiveness of structured PA interventions.},

  abstract = {Isometric assessment of muscular function is a popular form of testing which has been used in exercise science for over 40 years. It typically involves a maximal voluntary contraction performed at a specified joint angle against an unyielding resistance which is in series with a strain gauge, cable tensiometer, force platform or similar device whose transducer measures the applied force. Often both the maximum force and the rate of force development are recorded. These tests have generally shown high reliability in both single and multi-joint test protocols, although the maximum force is typically more reliable than rate of force development. This review outlines the reliability of isometric assessment and discusses a number of methodological considerations designed to enhance reliability and validity, including standardisation procedures, type of instructions, muscular pre-tension, testing position and joint angle. Currently, there appears to be considerable controversy as to the external validity of isometric assessment, particularly the ability of the tests to monitor changes in dynamic performance and their relationship to such performances. Indeed, a number of studies have recently shown that dynamic assessment modalities (isokinetic and isoinertial) are superior in terms of their relationship to dynamic performance and ability to discriminate between athletes of various performance levels compared with isometric assessment. This article reviews the use of isometric assessment in exercise science and consequently outlines a number of neural, mechanical and methodological factors which may have contributed to the contrasting research, and which may limit the ability of isometric assessment to relate to dynamic movement. Because of the large neural and mechanical differences between isometric and dynamic muscular actions, athletic assessment, which is dynamic in its nature, is generally most appropriately accomplished using dynamic muscular assessment methods, and in most instances isometric testing should be avoided.},

For more than a decade, resistance training has been recommended for adults, particularly older adults, as a prime preventive intervention, and increasing the prevalence of resistance training is an objective of Healthy People 2010. However, the prevalence rate for resistance training is only estimated at 10-15\% for older adults, despite the leisure time of older adults and access to facilities in developed countries. The reasons that the prevalence rate remains low include public health policy not emphasising resistance training, misinformation, and the lack of theoretically driven approaches demonstrating effective transfer and maintenance of training to minimally supervised settings once initial, generally successful, supervised training is completed. Social cognitive theory (SCT) has been applied to physical activity and aerobic training with some success, but there are aspects of resistance training that are unique including its intensity, progression, precision, and time and place specificity. Social cognitive theory, particularly with a focus on self-regulation and response expectancy and affect within an ecological context, can be directly applied to these unique aspects of resistance training for long-term maintenance.},

  abstract = {Sport and exercise scientists have a common focus: the scientific study of factors that influence our ability to perform exercise or physical activity. As a result, this ability is assessed and hence quantified. Accordingly, definitions of exercise and related terms and nomenclature that describe the performance of exercise must adhere to principles of science and satisfy the Syst\`eme International d'Unit\'es (SI) that was adopted universally in 1960. Frequently, these requirements are not met. The aims of this review are twofold: (1) to identify instances of non-compliance and (2) propose universal definitions of exercise and related terms and nomenclature that do conform to the SI and apply to exercise and physical activity that encompasses elite-standard competitive sport, activities of daily living, and clinical applications in rehabilitation and public health. A definition of exercise is offered: a potential disruption to homeostasis by muscle activity that is either exclusively, or in combination, concentric, eccentric or isometric.},

  abstract = {To predict maximal exercise capacity, we have developed the rating of perceived capacity (RPC) scale, based on metabolic equivalents (METs). MET values from 1 to 20 were listed on a progressive scale and linked to physical activities. Test subjects rated their perceived capacity by choosing the most strenuous activity and the corresponding MET value that they could sustain for 30 min. In order to validate the RPC, 87 healthy women participated in the study (age range 21-79 years). The capacity rated from the scale (MET(RPC)) was compared with the actual work capacity in a maximal incremental ramp cycle test. The maximal load achieved at the cycle test (in W), was transformed into the unit MET (MET(test)). The mean difference between MET(RPC) and MET(test) was -1.4 (3.18) (2SD). Multiple linear regression showed that MET(test) depended significantly on MET(RPC) and age. Extended regression analysis suggested that a nonlinear correction was most appropriate in order to improve the prediction. The maximal predicted capacity was given by: MET(pred) = (5.08 + 0.70 x MET(RPC))/[1+(e(0.059 (age-87.2)))]. After this correction, the mean difference between MET(pred) and MET(test) was reduced to 0.0 (2.62) (2SD). Reference values for MET(pred) and MET(test) were also obtained. In conclusion, the RPC combined with an age correction was shown to predict accurately maximal exercise capacity; it is also quick and easy to use. Thus, RPC may be a valuable tool in the prescription of exercise and in monitoring the effects of exercise and rehabilitation.},

To date, attempts at synthesising the data on ROM during resistance training have primarily focused on muscle hypertrophy in the lower body. Objective: Our aim was to meta-analyse and systematically review the effects of ROM on a variety of outcomes including hypertrophy, strength, sport, power and body-fat type outcomes. Following pre-registration and consistent with PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review of PubMed and SportsDISCUS was performed. Data was extracted and a Bayesian multi-level meta-analysis was performed. A range of exploratory sub-group and moderator analyses were performed. Results: The main model revealed a trivial SMD (0.12; 95\% CI: --0.02, 0.26) in favour of full ROM compared to partial ROM. When grouped by outcome, SMDs all favoured full ROM, but SMDs were trivial to small (all between 0.05 to 0.2). Sub-group analyses suggested there may be a muscle hypertrophy benefit to partial ROM training at long muscle lengths compared to using a full ROM (--0.28; 95\% CI: --0.81, 0.16). Analysis also suggested the existence of a specificity aspect to ROM, such that training in the ROM being tested as an outcome resulted in greater strength adaptations. No clear differences were found between upper- and lower-body adaptations when ROM was manipulated. Conclusions: Overall, our results suggest that using a full or long ROM may enhance results for most outcomes (strength, speed, power, muscle size, and body composition). Differences in adaptations are trivial to small. As such, partial ROM resistance training might present an efficacious alternative for variation and personal preference, or where injury prevents full-ROM resistance training.},

  abstract = {Most theories and hypotheses in psychology are verbal in nature, yet their evaluation overwhelmingly relies on inferential statistical procedures. The validity of the move from qualitative to quantitative analysis depends on the verbal and statistical expressions of a hypothesis being closely aligned -- that is, that the two must refer to roughly the same set of hypothetical observations. Here, I argue that many applications of statistical inference in psychology fail to meet this basic condition. Focusing on the most widely used class of model in psychology -- the linear mixed model -- I explore the consequences of failing to statistically operationalize verbal hypotheses in a way that respects researchers' actual generalization intentions. I demonstrate that although the ``random effect'' formalism is used pervasively in psychology to model intersubject variability, few researchers accord the same treatment to other variables they clearly intend to generalize over (e.g., stimuli, tasks, or research sites). The under-specification of random effects imposes far stronger constraints on the generalizability of results than most researchers appreciate. Ignoring these constraints can dramatically inflate false-positive rates, and often leads researchers to draw sweeping verbal generalizations that lack a meaningful connection to the statistical quantities they are putatively based on. I argue that failure to take the alignment between verbal and statistical expressions seriously lies at the heart of many of psychology's ongoing problems (e.g., the replication crisis), and conclude with a discussion of several potential avenues for improvement.},

  abstract = {This exploratory study hypothesized an inverted U relationship between self-efficacy (Bandura, 1997) and mental effort during mathematics problem solving by adults following suggestions by Salomon (1984) and Clark (1998). It was hypothesized that both low- and high-efficacy adults would invest lower mental effort in mathematics problems. Low-efficacy adults were expected to avoid the task because of a failure expectation. High-efficacy adults were expected to use automated mathematics problem solving strategies and invest low amounts of mental effort. Medium-efficacy adults were hypothesized to invest the greatest amount of mental effort due to their belief that they would not be successful without investing mental effort to solve the problems. Subjects were 48 adult volunteers (21 males and 27 females) ages 18-25 enrolled in a university introductory psychology course. Mental effort was measured using two methods found to be effective previously: self-report and a "dual task" requirement to estimate time passing during problem solving (Cennamo, 1992). Mathematics tasks with cognitive loads of 10 were used, following Sweller (1994). Subjects were given misleading performance feedback to encourage them toward low, medium, or high self-efficacy levels. Results partially supported the hypothesis of a curvilinear, inverted U relationship between self-efficacy and mental effort. High-efficacy subjects reported significantly lower mental effort than medium- or low-efficacy subjects did. Yet the mental effort scores of low- and medium-efficacy subjects were similar, perhaps due to cultural differences affecting medium effort for Asian subjects (Mizokawa \& Ryckman, 1990). Self-efficacy was only partially affected by the feedback manipulation. Mathematics performance was significantly correlated with self-efficacy scores (r = .43). Scores for medium- and high-efficacy subjects were similar even though high-efficacy subjects invested less mental effort than medium-efficacy subjects did. This buttresses the argument that high-efficacy adults invest less effort in learning and problem solving because they have high levels of automated skills. Subjects with high mathematics task self-efficacy had significantly higher time estimation performance than low-efficacy subjects, supporting the theory that people with high self-efficacy invest low amounts of mental effort. Subjects applied the mental effort they did not need to use in the mathematics task to the time estimation task. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Including the perspectives of scientists about the nature and process of science is important for an authentic and nuanced portrayal of science in science education. The small number of studies that have explored scientists' worldviews about science has thus far generated contradictory findings, with recent studies claiming that scientists simultaneously hold contradictory sophisticated and na\"ive views. This article reports on an exploratory study that uses the framework of Bhaskar's critical realism to elicit and separately analyse academic scientists' ontological and epistemological views about science in semi-structured interviews. When the views of scientists are analysed through the lens of critical realism, it is clear that it is possible to hold a realist ontological commitment about what knowledge is of, simultaneously with a fallibilist epistemological commitment about knowledge itself. The apparent incongruence of scientists' so-called na\"ive and sophisticated views about science is resolved when analysed using a critical realist framework. Critical realism offers a simple and coherent framework for science educators that avoids many of the problems of positivism and social constructivism by finding a middle ground between them. The three pillars of critical realism: ontological realism, epistemological fallibilism and judgmental rationality help to make sense of how socially constructed scientific knowledge can be anchored in an independent reality.},

Thirty-eight healthy women completed a 9-week resistance training program consisting of either 4 sets of 12 repetitions to volitional failure of inclined bicep curls (INC group) or preacher curls (PREA group), three times per week. Pre- and post-intervention muscle thickness was measured using B-mode ultrasound imaging with a linear-array transducer. Scan acquisition sites were determined by measuring 50\%, 60\% and 70\% of the distance between the posterior crest of the acromion and the olecranon. Statistical significance was set at p {$<$} 0.05. No region of the INC group grew when comparing pre- to post-intervention. The 70\% region of the PREA group grew significantly (muscle thickness increased from 2.7  0.43 cm to 2.94  0.44 cm). We found no growth differences between regions when analysing per group (p = 0.274), region (p = 0.571) or group*region (p = 0.367). Our results show that the distal region of the arm grows in response to the preacher curl that places the highest amount of strain in the range of motion in which the arm muscles are more elongated.},

  abstract = {Stevens' theory of admissible statistics (1946) states that measurement levels should guide the choice of statistical test, such that the truth value of statements based on a statistical analysis remains invariant under admissible transformations of the data. Lord (1953) challenged this theory. In a thought experiment, a t-test is performed on football numbers (identifying players: a nominal representation) to decide whether a sample from the machine issuing these numbers should be considered non-random. This is an inadmissible test, since its outcomes are not invariant under admissible transformations for the nominal measurement level. Nevertheless, it results in a sensible conclusion: the number-issuing machine was tampered with. The present aim is to show that the thought experiment contains a serious flaw. First, the assumption that the numbers are nominal is shown to be false. Second, it is argued that the football numbers represent the amount of bias in the machine. The level of bias in the machine, indicated by the population mean, conforms to a bisymmetric structure, which means that it lies on an interval scale. In this light, Lord's thought experiment interpreted by many as a problematic counterexample to Stevens' theory of admissible statistics conforms perfectly to Stevens' dictum.},

  abstract = {When individuals set goals, they consider the subjective value (SV) of the anticipated reward and the required effort, a trade-off that is of great interest to psychological research. One approach to quantify the SVs of levels of a cognitive task is the Cognitive Effort Discounting Paradigm by Westbrook and colleagues (2013). However, it fails to acknowledge the highly subjective nature of effort, as it assumes a unidirectional, inverse relationship between task load and SVs. Therefore, it cannot map differences in effort perception that arise from traits like Need for Cognition, since individuals who enjoy effortful cognitive activities likely do not prefer the easiest level. We aim to replicate the analysis of Westbrook and colleagues with our adaptation, the Cognitive and Affective Discounting (CAD) Paradigm, which quantifies SVs without assuming that the easiest level is preferred, thereby enabling the quantification of SVs for tasks without objective order of task load.},
